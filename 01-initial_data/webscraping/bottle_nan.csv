Ànima Negra ÀN/2 2020,£22.00,,Red wine,Wines without GI ,"Callet, Fogoneu, Cabernet Sauvignon",Ànima Negra Viticultors,"ÀN/2 is a little gift, but a most rewarding one, from the Mediterranean countryside, presented by a team that champions native varieties and wines with a personality all of their own.
No doubt few people have heard of varieties such as Callet or Fogoneu (or Manto Negro, although not present in all of this wine’s vintages); they are varieties found in Mallorca, adapted to its land, able to convey the special characteristics of the soil, abundant in iron oxide, and to exhibit some distinctive aromas.
ÀN/2 is a sincere wine. It is accessible, high quality, well-made, reflecting the typicality of Mallorca; it has personality, and offers a very good pleasure/price ratio.","Once in the glass, we can predict that it will be an accessible wine: a dark red Morello cherry colour but of medium density, not showing great concentration, very clean and bright. When we bring it close to the nose, we immediately appreciate the wide array of aromas. It appears very open and accessible, without being extreme: aromas of fresh, ripe fruit (cherries, strawberries, even a subtle waft of cherries in liqueur), sweet notes, of sweet strawberry, balsamic notes and a mineral background of dry stone. It is very fresh, undeniably a Mediterranean wine, enshrouded by a gentle perfume of smoky hints and lactic notes. A wine of remarkable complexity.
On the palate, that sweetness discerned on the nose contrasts with a faint bitterness which makes the wine extremely memorable. It is intense, balanced and an easy drink; generous, medium-bodied, with earthy undertones and traces of pepper which, along with its good acidity, result in a delicious, refreshing sensation. Enveloping and elegant (it makes us think of a Burgundy Pinot Noir), juicy and rounded – the memory of it is reluctant to take its leave… but not the bottle; that is easily finished and gone.
As regards the aftertaste, some light toasty nuances and scrubland notes bring the tasting to a close. Most satisfactory.",,,,"The Ànima Negra story began by chance, like many other stories do, when three Majorcan friends, Francesc Grimalt, Pere Obrador and Miguel Ángel Cerdà came up with the idea of making a wine from native grape varieties found growing in the surrounding countryside.
It happened not so long ago (in about 1994), but thanks to the great enthusiasm they felt for this project and the excellent results obtained right from the start, it can now be truthfully said that their winery has...",Serve between 16ºC and 17ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.0,,,Wood,12 months,New and semi-new,French and American oak,,,,,,,,,4.5,28,91+,,2020.0,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/anmn220_anv800_1646158842.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/anima-negra-an-2/,2020.0,91.5
Viña Tondonia Reserva Blanco 2012,£74.20,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Bodegas R. López de Heredia ,"Tondonia whites are much more than classics. They are icons of tradition, examples of honesty and wines which exude knowledge, craftsmanship and authenticity. They are wines with principles and wines without an end; their extraordinary acidity makes them virtually eternal. They are extremely pleasant, elegant and profound, and wines you could never tire of drinking.
If the Gran Reserva is perhaps out of many people's reach, the Blanco Reserva is a wine that you should try at least once in your life, and one to always have in the cellar if possible; it is a particularly 'gastronomic' wine, relating well to food, perfect for fish and fried or grilled shellfish, cheeses such as Brie, Parmesan and Manchego, risottos, seafood rice dishes, fish stews, lobster, pasta dishes with truffles, mushrooms, asparagus, potatoes with cod or monkfish, scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms or fresh garlic, white tuna with tomato or onion... This is a white but at heart a red, much more vinous than fruit-driven, ideal for serving with food.
The honesty of a Tondonia white becomes clear starting with the bottle: transparent. The cork is superb; this wine can be kept for years and years, with no expiry date. In the glass, a vivid bright gold, eternally young. On the nose... give it some time; after maturing for six years in barrel and resting for a long time in bottle, it needs to breathe; if you can, decant it. Describing it is difficult because its aromatic palette is very well integrated. We can discover aromas of very ripe yellow fruits, moist notes of fallen leaves but also of sea air, saline and iodine notes, hints of fine wood... of pencil shavings, suggestions of fennel and aniseed, white almonds, very subtle notes too of fruit peel, like orange, loquats and dried apricots, and dry earth... but in essence, Tondonia Blanco has a mystical touch, an aromatic profile that we associate with the smell emanating from old tomes and rooms perfumed with incense. The Blanco Reserva is a journey in time, a resurgence of fond memories.
It is firm and dry on the palate; harmonious, balanced and elegant. Its entry is smooth but weighty, and it is oily, although without the Gran Reserva’s viscosity. This is definitely a fine white wine, bearing the Tondonia signature.  ","R. López de Heredia (Viña Tondonia) is one of the names which inspires most respect and admiration with regard to wineries producing ""fine wine"".

Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva Histórico 1981,£231.90,,Red Wine,Rioja ,"Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo, Graciano",Bodegas R. López de Heredia ,"Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva wines are very rich and elegant, eminently appealing and satisfying. Their lengthy ageing, lasting ten years, with racking carried out by hand twice a year, endows them with certain special characteristics that make them particularly long-lived; these are wines which, if they have been kept well, can be enjoyed after a period of many, many years.
The Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva is a delicate wine, with a very fine nose, dry and smooth on the palate, rounded and precise, as are all the wines from this emblematic company, a wine which will always be remembered and proves a delicious accompaniment to meats, poultry and fish without too much seasoning. It is the ideal wine for extra special celebrations and occasions.
If drinking a Gran Reserva from Viña Tondonia really is a little luxury and having a bottle in the cellar equates to owning treasure, being able to get hold of one of their most memorable vintages is a real privilege, within reach of few, and not just because of its price: Viña Tondonia only offers its historic wines to a very small number of customers, rewarding their loyalty, and this occurs on rare occasions when a very limited number of bottles are secured.
-----------------------------------
Storage conditions for the historic wines now available from Vinissimus
Vinissimus would like to inform its customers that bottles of the historic vintages of Viña Tondonia and Viña Bosconia are not being stored in our fine wine cellar but in the actual underground cellars of Bodegas R. López de Heredia, in Haro (La Rioja), the best guarantee that the wine has always been kept in optimum conditions.
Bottles will only leave the winery in Haro to be sent to customers who have requested them in their Vinissimus orders, in special packaging deemed fit by the actual winery, so that the best possible care is taken of them during transit.
Information about the characteristics of the bottles and returns guarantee
A customer who purchases one of these historic bottles should be aware that the wine and bottle are very special, with no entitlement to a refund.
Since the bottles have been resting in the winery's cellars for many years, at a constant temperature with high humidity, not only can they acquire mould and dust, but this will be left on the bottles, and they will be dispatched exactly as they are, in their natural state, as an additional proof of their true age.
Moreover, due to the fact that these bottles have been filled by hand and have been ageing over a long period of time, the height of the wine in the bottle neck is always irregular, even including wines from the same vintage. These wines have been bottled, sealed and labelled by hand.
Returns will only be accepted in the case of bottles verified as corked and the defect will need confirmation from the winery itself. In such an eventuality, the customer should send back the bottle with its contents, cork and original packaging, to the address as notified by Vinissimus. A new bottle will be sent out, only if the defect is confirmed by the winery.
Recommendations for enjoying a historic wine
After you have received the wine, you should allow it to settle for at least a week, preferably in a quiet, dark, cool place. The storage temperature and humidity should be constant. Humidity between 70-80% and temperature between 18-20º C.
If you decide to decant the wine, we recommend doing this carefully and allowing the wine to settle in the decanter for at least an hour before serving. Take great care when pouring, trying not to move the decanter unduly.
If you decide not to decant, we also recommend letting the bottle settle by keeping it vertical for an hour, so that any possible sediment remains at the bottom. Care should be taken when opening the bottle, since a cork may lose its elasticity over the years. Pour the wine with care, ensuring minimal movement of the bottle.","R.

Finca Durona 2016,£18.30,,Red wine,Penedès ,"Sumoll, Syrah, Garnacha, Cariñena, Merlot",Bodega Heretat Mont-Rubí,"The Heretat Mont-Rubí winery owns over 300 hectares of vineyards, woodland and mountainous terrain in the municipality of L'Avellà. Most of the vines they cultivate are local Penedès varieties such as Sumoll, Grenache, Carignan, and white grapes like the Xarel·lo and the Parellada. Mont-Rubí pay special attention to the Sumoll, a rich traditional grape variety which fell out of favour for different reasons and is scarcely cultivated nowadays. The Mont-Rubí winery is the first modern cellar to believe in the Sumoll and its expressiveness once more.
The Durona wine comes from vines planted at altitudes of between 500 and 700 metres in the Alt Penedès region. Its coupage is mainly based on Sumoll, together with Syrah, Grenache, Carignan, and a little Merlot. After vinification, it is aged in French and American oak barrels for twelve months before being left to stand in the bottle.","In the glass, it has a light crimson colour and its lack of density is perhaps an indicator of its subtlety. It is easy to distinguish from other wines because of its delicious aromas; delicate hints of cologne, lactic notes, leather, coffee, toffee, damp woodland, orange peel, honey and quince ... Moving it around the glass awakens smooth aromas of embers, figs, fine dark chocolate and glue. We recommend decanting this wine as on first opening it is sometimes a little closed with aromas of forests and truffles.
It offers an elegant consistency in the mouth, with little density which means its very fresh character can show through. In fact, two different sensations can be experienced; a more fatty profile, like mineral water, and a fresher wine side. An all-round wine, the Durona surrounds us from many directions.",,,,"Founded in 1984 in an old 19th century building, Bodega Heretat Mont-Rubí is located on an estate ina large area of forestland and vineyards around the village of L'Avellà in the Alt Penedès region. Their project is key to understanding the recent history of the Catalan grape variety Sumoll which would most probably have disappeared if it hadn't been for the winery's hard work and commitment to cultivating and using it.

Rosa Rivero Mencía Crianza 2017,£16.20,,Red wine,Valdeorras ,Mencia,Virxe de Galir,"The first and, so far, only Crianza wine from the Valdeorras DO and Galicia. This excellent limited-edition wine is the pride of the Virgen del Galir winery, made with grapes selected with the utmost care and attention from century-old terraced slate vineyards in the magnificent Valdemioto estate located at an altitude of 500 metres.
Harvested by hand, the grapes are destemmed but not crushed before undergoing a cold pre-fermentation maceration at 0ºC for 4 days to extract the essence of the fruit's primary aromas. Local yeasts are used for the alcoholic fermentation and following the secondary malolactic fermentation, the wine is left to stand for 12 months in French oak barrels and a further minimum of 6 months in the bottle before going on sale.
The 2017 harvest in the last week of August that year was the earliest ever in Valdeorras and produced one of the lowest yields on record due to the tough frosts experienced the previous spring. However, its quality was excellent and produced splendid, fresh and aromatic wines with a clear Atlantic character.
Rosa Vivero Mencía Crianza is a pure slate wine whose measured wood simply rounds off and highlights the sublime quality of its fruit. The Mencia grapes and balance of a wine from inland Galicia are immediately noticeable as are the spicy notes from its time in barrels and the mature sensations of grapes which have made the most of months of sunlight. It offers a virtually perfect harmony between maturity and freshness, with hints of ash sitting over fragrances of plums and blackcurrants. Herbal flavours bring to mind forest undergrowth and eucalyptus fruit.

Michelini i Mufatto El Rapolao 2019,£75.20,,Red wine,Bierzo ,Mencia,Michelini i Mufatto,"All the Michelini i Mufatto wines are outstanding, yet this is the one that shares fewer similarities with their other wines. However, it does most resemble other great Bierzo wines. The reason for this, its place of origin: the El Rapolao vineyard, where, despite being one of Valtuille’s coolest areas, the climate is warmer than can be found in Ponferrada, from where the rest of the Michelini i Mufatto wines originate, and the soil has a different composition: clay, instead of slate. This means the wine has a higher alcohol content than what we usually find from this family, although equally fresh, juicy and with their customary finesse. Undoubtedly, a Rapolao to add to the list of essentials for getting to know this exceptional vineyard, shared by master winemaker Raúl Pérez’s group of friends.","El Rapolao is a vineyard situated in Valtuille, known for having been the first ‘paraje’ or specific site to appear on several Bierzo wine labels, once regulations had been set up to identify small geographical units. This system has created the following divisions in the Bierzo: regional wines (vinos regionales), village wines (vinos de villa), wines from a specific site (vinos de paraje), wines from cru classified vineyards (vinos de viñas clasificadas) and grand cru classified vineyards (grandes viñas clasificadas). This one is a vineyard shared by different vine growers-winemakers, planted on a slope in one of the coolest areas of Valtuille, due to its easterly orientation, and which characteristically provides wines of great delicacy, in the Burgundy style.",,,,,,Sausages and hamStews and casserolesRiceRed meatGameCured cheeses,Contains sulfites,14.0,900  bottles,,Amphoras,Between 10 and 15 months,Used,French oak,,,,60 years,Clay,Continental with Atlantic influence,West,500.00 meters,0.0,0,94,,2019.0,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/mmrpl19_anv800_1651583802.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/michelini-i-mufatto-el-rapolao/,2019.0,94.0

Regina Viarum Mencía 2022,£14.45,,Red wine,Ribeira Sacra ,Mencia,Bodegas Regina Viarum,"A splendid wine made with grapes collected by hand from south-west facing vineyards on steep slopes in the town of Doade (within the Amandi region of Ribeira Sacra). The warmth of the slate and schist soils helps the fruit to ripen and adds personality to the wine. Located at a midway point between the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates, the ripening process here is perfect and gives the wine an excellent balance between maturity and freshness. Grapes are destemmed and crushed ready for a 72-hour maceration at very cool temperatures. The must then undergoes a controlled fermentation with daily racking (delestage) and pumping over at a maximum temperature of 28 degrees to extract all the colour, aromas and complexity. Standing for 6 months on its lees in stainless steel tanks, rather than wood, preserves its fruity character.
Displaying a transparent and deep Picota cherry colour with violet glints, Regina Viarum is a flowing wine but also a splendid example of typicity. Lifting the glass near your nose for a moment is long enough to recognize it as a Mencia wine. It combines wild red fruit with fine notes of smoke, redcurrants and cherries, alongside hints of ash and pepper. Serving it cool will bring out its Atlantic character, but around 16º it offers a depth rarely seen in wines at this price. Fresh and smooth in the mouth with a balanced acidity and elegant and polished tannins, it has a pleasant and lingering fruity and herbal finish.

Resulting from such high quality grapes as these and after an ageing period of about 18 months, comes Aalto PS, an excellent wine for cellaring.

The Vega Sicilia approach to meticulous care over details ensures high quality standards throughout all wine-making processes, under the auspices of company oenologist Xavier Ausás.
Particular consideration is paid to the ageing process which lasts for up to 18 months in new French oak casks and almost the same length of time spent resting in bottle.
These periods are regarded as essential for blending and harmonizing the fruit and wood, so that the finest aromas and flavours ensue and create a wine of exceptional elegance. Deeply-coloured and firmly-structured, from grapes ripened to perfection in the vineyard, it reveals the characteristics of its terroir and maintains the winery’s long-standing commitment to the production of premier quality wines.","This winery was acquired in 1992 by the owners of Vega Sicilia, the Álvarez family, for the purpose of creating a Ribera del Duero wine that was distinct and independent from the flagship brand.

Albariño Mar de Frades 2022,£23.15,,White wine,Rías Baixas ,Albariño,Mar de Frades,"Much more than a great white wine, Mar de Frades is an amazing example of the expressiveness contained in Albariño grapes. A unique wine with hints of the sea and a seductive elegant freshness and spectacular character in an unmistakable blue bottle.
Vines grow on hillsides facing the Ría de Arousa estuary in the heart of the Salnés valley. Only the very best grapes, perfectly ripe and healthy, are chosen and taken in small crates to the winery for processing where a careful selection process removes about another 13% of the grapes which are not considered good enough to produce Mar de Frades. The fruit is then macerated with its skins for 40 hours in a carbon dioxide rich environment to avoid any chance of oxidation or spreading of bacteria. The result is a clean and extremely floral wine must which is then fermented with its own yeasts to bring out the Atlantic and varietal aromas. Finally, the wine is left to stand on its lees for 5 months to create a rounded and wide final product.
The Mar de Frades bottle features a heat-sensitive label which reveals an illustration of a small boat when the wine is cooled to its ideal serving temperature. On pouring it displays a crystal-clear lemon yellow colour with glints of green apple, a radiant aspect which invites us to lift a glass and admire the floral notes of jasmine and violets blended in with fennel, mango and apricots and intense saline notes. Daring and forceful on the palate, Mar de Frades is a white wine brimming with ripe fruit and persistent sensations of freshness which eventually lead to a sophisticated finish with a wonderful Atlantic character. Try it and you are sure to understand why this popular wine has deservedly won a place among the best white wines in Spain.",,Pale yellow / Greenish glints,Fruit aromas / Peach / Lemon peel / Herbaceous notes / Mineral notes,Fresh / Silky / Long / Balsamic notes / Saline notes,,Serve between 5ºC and 6ºC,,Contains sulfites,12.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.6,44,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/mdfra22_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/albarino-mar-de-frades/,2022.0,

Can Noves 2014,£18.55,,Red wine,Wines without GI ,"Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot",Eccociwine,"Just outside Girona, in the small village of Sant Martí Vell, surrounded by forests and in soils originally volcanic, the vines of the EccociWine winery have taken root. Their wines can't come under the Empordà DO due to their location, however vine growing in this Girona district goes back a very long way.
The winery's philosophy is to take good care of the countryside which in return will allow them to reap its rewards. Thus, wines made by EccociWine clearly denote their setting, as Can Noves Negre goes to show, the winery's semi-Crianza red that's proving a big hit with specialist critics and ordinary consumers alike.
It's made with Bordeaux varieties, perfectly adapted to the region and harvested by hand, which are then vinified separately, with the clear objective of obtaining the maximum expressiveness possible from each of them. It exhibits a nose evocative of wild black fruit (blackberries and very ripe blueberries) and ash on a lactic background. Subtle suggestions of toasted almond skin bring to mind restrained oak and the odd hint of orange peel rounds off the ensemble. Its palate is juicy, spicy, with elegant rounded tannins. Superb acidity takes it energetically right through to a dry, delicate and totally well-balanced finish in which feint hints of cocoa and intense mineral notes can be discerned.

Naturally, with a name like this we're expecting a mineral wine. So it is.

Unsi Terrazas Tinto 2016,£17.50,,Red wine,Navarre ,Garnacha,Unsi Wines,"The Baja Montaña region in the east of Navarre, bordering with Aragon, is home to some of the best vineyards in the Navarre appellation. Unfortunately, the challenges of working this hilly terrain led to farmers abandoning many vineyards in the past. Many plots had difficult access for machinery and only offered a low yield come harvest-time, off-putting factors at a time when mass production was becoming the order of the day. Unsi is a new project committed to changing this situation around by devoting production to quality rather than quantity. The name Unsi was the old name for the area surrounding the village of San Martín de Unx where the vineyards are located. For Unsi, the remote isolation of these lands and their natural low-yield productions are seen as opportunities instead of problems.
Old vines thrive on terraces at different altitudes and with a variety of soils such as slate-based soil, chalky-clay, and others, to offer us a wine with a unique personality. We could almost describe the Unsi Terrazas Tinto as a Navarrese Grenache from the New World — if such a wine were possible. It blends the best of fresh fruit from mountain vineyards in northern Spain with the warmth and pleasantness of its wood which gives it a certain New World touch. This wine exudes aromas of vanilla and strawberries, brambles and violets, alongside a hint of scrubland which evokes memories of the woodlands surrounding the vines. It is juicy, fresh, and full-bodied in the mouth; an exceptionally rounded wine with a sweet hint thanks, in part, to its time spent ageing in wood, and, in part, to the character of the Grenache.

Piélago 2018,£34.75,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Bodegas Jiménez-Landi,"Piélago is pure Garnacha and pure succulence. Uncork the bottle, pour yourself a glass and let it speak for itself. Its complexity abounds with delightfully harmonious contrasts: aromas of fresh flowers juxtaposed with notes of wild mountain herbs, and dried herbs; strawberries, fresh raspberries, water melon, pomegranates... and other red fruits that combine acidity with a compact sweetness, a real lusciousness; notes of damp leaves against subtle smoky hints; earthy nuances on a liquor background... It smells of woods, undergrowth and dry leaves... and of old tomes too. Countless aromas immediately come to the fore, leading us forward to seduction on the palate: direct, refined, very easy to drink but with a marked tannic structure, meatiness and vibrant acidity. A very well-balanced wine, that shows great respect for the environment, reflecting and conveying this most naturally.
Piélago is named after the hill which crowns the vines that Jiménez-Landi uses to make this wine, conceived as a 'village wine', from the village of El Real de San Vicente, in the province of Toledo. A Garnacha which we might describe as mid-way between Atlantic and Mediterranean, a Garnacha with its own character. Authentic, refined, fresh and feminine. A Garnacha to savour and relish, right till the last drop. ","Bodegas Jiménez-Landi is a family-run enterprise which has arisen out of passion for the land and vines, and inherited the tradition both of former generations and also the actual area in which it is located, Méntrida, a town near the Sierra de Gredos mountains whose wine-growing past dates back to the 12th Century.

Piélago 2018,£34.75,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Bodegas Jiménez-Landi,"Piélago is pure Garnacha and pure succulence. Uncork the bottle, pour yourself a glass and let it speak for itself. Its complexity abounds with delightfully harmonious contrasts: aromas of fresh flowers juxtaposed with notes of wild mountain herbs, and dried herbs; strawberries, fresh raspberries, water melon, pomegranates... and other red fruits that combine acidity with a compact sweetness, a real lusciousness; notes of damp leaves against subtle smoky hints; earthy nuances on a liquor background... It smells of woods, undergrowth and dry leaves... and of old tomes too. Countless aromas immediately come to the fore, leading us forward to seduction on the palate: direct, refined, very easy to drink but with a marked tannic structure, meatiness and vibrant acidity. A very well-balanced wine, that shows great respect for the environment, reflecting and conveying this most naturally.
Piélago is named after the hill which crowns the vines that Jiménez-Landi uses to make this wine, conceived as a 'village wine', from the village of El Real de San Vicente, in the province of Toledo. A Garnacha which we might describe as mid-way between Atlantic and Mediterranean, a Garnacha with its own character. Authentic, refined, fresh and feminine. A Garnacha to savour and relish, right till the last drop. ","Bodegas Jiménez-Landi is a family-run enterprise which has arisen out of passion for the land and vines, and inherited the tradition both of former generations and also the actual area in which it is located, Méntrida, a town near the Sierra de Gredos mountains whose wine-growing past dates back to the 12th Century.

Petrea Chardonnay 2015,£28.25,,White wine,Penedès ,Chardonnay,Mas Comtal,"Petrea Chardonnay is one of the two special wines from Mas Comtal, a wine meticulously cared for down to the last detail, including its beautiful labels which are different for each vintage. This is their more serious and complete white, and an elegant wine with great persistence on the palate.
It is only made in the best years, from Chardonnay grapes grown in organically cultivated vineyards, on vines now over 30 years old, which the winery planted when the company underwent renovation, in a major drive towards top quality wines. In the wine-making process, it is partially fermented in stainless steel tanks (30%) and in Hungarian oak barrels (70%), a wood that has an effect upon wine similar to French oak, not overly harsh; then it is matured on its lees and undergoes bâttonage for just over 10 months. The result is a wine with sinew, great body and structure, and a very pleasant passage through the mouth.
Mas Comtal makes its Petrea Chardonnay available to consumers only at its optimal point for drinking, after some four years of evolution in bottle. In the glass it appears a lovely new gold colour, clean and bright, and if you uncork it during the first months after its release, you can still discern the aromas of that new wood in all its freshness, which rapidly blends in with the aromas of peaches and mangos, ripe fleshy fruits, and a floral fragrance, of orange blossom. The citrus and refreshing notes seem to come to life somewhat later, on swirling the glass or when decanted beforehand: aromas of grapefruit and mint tea. The aromatic palette is extremely rich, a fine Mediterranean Chardonnay, a fresh one without excessive maturation.
It has an exceptional palate. Its entry takes you by storm and its intensity permeates the whole mouth. It comes over luscious and glycerin-textured, but its excellent acidity and certain saline notes mean that it glides smoothly over the tongue. It is a wine that builds up on the palate, with mild caramel notes, toasted hazelnuts and honey. It is long and persistent, with a structure and complexity that make it an ideal wine for pairing up with both meats and cheese, perfect for ham... and a dessert in itself.","Albert and Joan Mila decided in the early 1980s to establish their own winery in the same house where they grew up and came to love the world of viticulture.
Located in the most easterly part of the Penedès region, at the foot of the Ordal and Garraf mountain ranges, influenced by the sea and protected to the north by the beautiful massif of Montserrat, Mas Comtal enjoys excellent conditions for vine-growing: 40 ha. of vineyards planted with the native variety Xarel.lo,...",,,,,Serve between 10ºC and 12ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.0,,,,,,,,,Organic,,,,,,0.0,0,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/petch15_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/petrea-chardonnay/,2015.0,

Pequeño Santos 2020,£14.45,,White wine,Rías Baixas ,Albariño,Benito Santos,"Pequeño Santos is the latest venture of Todd Bloomberg, after years of experience. It is a wine that is not as pretentious as its older siblings, yet it bears all the hallmarks of a 100% Albariño, whose great merit lies in its ability to offer a combination of fantastic quality and a very reasonable price, which is no easy task nowadays.
Under Todd's direction as wine-maker, the wines succeed in expressing the best of the region's characteristics. The wines conform totally to organic farming methods, which include the customary use of sheep manure and green vegetable matter fertilisers, in pellet form, and nettle purine (fermented nettle tea). Natural yeasts, emanating from the organic vineyards, are the only ones used in the production of these wines. The vines are worked in parcels, château-style, and the soil composition, which is based on sand, limestone and clay, endows the wines with an unusual complexity. A clear example of this singularity is the estate known as Pago de Xoan, where on occasions the vineyard is flooded by the estuary water, which contributes some saline and iodine notes, not normal traits found in Spanish white wines. ","In 1965 Benito Santos was the first vine grower invited to sell his wine at the Albariño Festival. He has since died and been buried in the grounds of the Monastery of Cálago, at Vilanova de Arousa. His work showed his sincerity and respect for nature (organic farming), enabling the production of wines that exhibit the marked effect of their terroir.
Benito Santos held the view that wines should be made in the vineyard and not in the winery.

A Mi Manera 2018,£20.90,,Nouveau wine,Rioja ,Tempranillo,Bodega Contador,"Benjamín Romeo is particularly well-known for his great Contador, but all his wines are a wonderful reflection of quality grapes, extremely well-cared for (Benjamín is the vine grower), thoroughly likeable wines from start to finish.
A Mi Manera is his carbonic maceration red, a wine flawless in the making, using the best grapes, full of fruit aromas, intense and juicy, elegant... a wine to fall in love with. It has a lovely colour, as though there were rose petals floating in the glass, lively, an intense cherry colour with a carmine rim.
It is fruit poured into a glass - chewy, juicy fruit, but with a balance that is exceedingly fine; intense, dense but velvety, attractive, a wine where complexity is not sought after, but offering the most genuine fruit expression. A wine which, even though it is young, we shouldn't expect to be simple; exactly the opposite, this wine is complete, with some shy lactic notes found in the aftertaste. It is simply Benjamín ‘in his own way’, and what a way that is!
(A Mi Manera is made with grapes originating from vine-stock planted in parcels with poor soils, mainly calcareous clay, and vinified in large truncated conical vats, with a 10,000 litre capacity.)","Love of the land, respect for deep-rooted traditions, excellent judgement… and passion, lots of passion.

Número Nueve 2017,£15.35,,Red wine,Ribera del Queiles ,"Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc",Winery Arts,"Number 9 is considered by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom. The number 9 represents the ternary triangle: the corporal, the intellectual and the spiritual.
With this idea of 'completeness', three dimensions which can reach perfection when united, although each one on its own forms part of the whole, Winery Arts presents its innovative “Number nine” ('Número Nueve') collection.
Comprising three wines with each one having its own particular symbolism: Tres al cuadrado (3 squared) represents the physical world; Seis al Revés (6 inverted), the power of thought; and Número Nueve (number 9), the transcendental; three singular wines made with consummate care, sourced from selected vines in old, low-yielding vineyards (around 1,500 kg/ha), which grow on steeply-sloping hillsides at the foot of the Moncayo mountain, difficult slopes to cultivate but where vineyards manage to withstand the passing of centuries.
'Número Nueve' represents the world of the transcendental and completes the trilogy, offering a complex, subtle wine, showing great persistence, and with well-ripened, almost preserve-like, fruit very much to the fore.
The wine is a dark cherry-red colour and very dense, with purplish hues on the rim. The nose is complex and subtle, with aromas of very ripe black fruit, almost jammy, as well as spicy, coffee and scrubland notes. Generous, structured and lengthy on the palate, with ripe tannins and considerable persistence, all its aromatic complexity reappears via the retronasal passage.
Aged for over 16 months in new French oak barrels.","Winery Arts makes its debut in the wine world with an innovative collection of three wines which recall the symbolism of number nine, believed by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom: Tres al Cuadrado, Seis al Revés and Número Nueve, three wines carefully made using grapes originating from a selection of old, low-yielding vineyards and which correspond to three different concepts, three styles, all three essential for reaching the required 'fullness'.

Revealing an intense nose and a structured and flavoursome palate, this interesting wine shows us once again the expertise of the young La Mancha winery.
The wine is a deep, dark cherry colour, almost black and with purple hues on the rim. The nose is closed at the beginning and needs some air to open it up. When that happens, mineral notes appear (chalk and ink) and red fruits (raspberries). Weighty on the palate, rounded and earthy, it reveals toasty wood underpinned by fruit liqueur and liquorice.

Roig Parals La Botera 2018,£15.40,,Red wine,Empordà ,"Cariñena, Cabernet Sauvignon",Roig Parals,"La Botera, from Roig Parals, is a blend of Cariñena grapes (80%) originating from century-old vines and Cabernet Sauvignon (20%). An interesting coupâge which brings together two apparently dissimilar types - the femininity of the Cariñena and the masculinity of the Cabernet - to produce a balanced, rounded and extremely pleasant wine at a very good price.
Roig Parals is a small family-owned winery at Mollet de Peralada, in the Alt Empordà region, set up by Santi Roig and Mariona Parals, with vine-growing in their ancestry, and running a modest and unpretentious operation, virtually unknown until in 2012 Jancis Robinson announced that its Camí de Cormes 2007 was her favourite red from the region. It was unbelievable the amount of interest aroused thanks to her appraisal of that single varietal Cariñena. This is a winery which works exceedingly well, its wines reflect the region’s personality, true for the reds as well as their white and rosé, and their prices are affordable; so a producer worth getting to know in the Empordà.
On the nose, it is the Cariñena which defines the wine’s character, with its fruitiness and refinement. It seems rather shy to begin with but gradually starts releasing its seductive qualities, exhibiting ripe fruit, earthy notes (the parcel contains a lot of flint in the ground), gently balsamic… The nose is sensual, accompanied by fresh peppery hints and smoky nuances, more appropriate to Cabernet. Dissimilar or not, the truth is that these two varietals complement each other perfectly in this fresh and considerably complex wine (bearing in mind the price bracket it sits in).
On the palate, it is a complete wine, with a pleasing entry, ripe fruit (ripe plums and raspberries too), a certain amount of body yet light and easily drinkable. A wine with just six months of barrel-ageing, not overly powerful but juicy, with the wood well-integrated, good backbone and smooth tannins.","The Roig Parals winery is located in the centre of Mollet de Peralada and its vineyards lie around the village. The land they work amounts to around 14 hectares, 10 of which belong to the family, where they cultivate the red varieties Cariñena (with vine stock dating back to 1896), Cabernet and Merlot, with Moscatel, Macabeo and Garnacha the whites.

Ponte da Boga Mencía 2020,£14.10,,Red wine,Ribeira Sacra ,Mencia,Adega Ponte da Boga,"Within the boundaries of lovely Castro Caldelas, where the vineyards follow the path of the River Sil, nestles the Ponte da Boga winery, boasting around 20 hectares of vineyards located in different sub-regions of the Ribira Sacra. Its secret lies with the willing contributions of the small-scale vine growers who are sub-contracted annually to supply their healthy, quality grapes. The countryside provides a beautiful landscape, with small plots perched on the sheer, stony terraces.
Dominique Roujou, the expert French oenologist, is the corner stone in this wine-growing project taken to the extreme, with harvesting causing particular difficulties on the steep slopes. Yet his wines manage to reflect to perfection this heroic environment.Ponte da Boga Mencía harks back to the olden days, recalling how Mencia wines used to be made locally before they gradually disappeared with the tide of change. This is the bodega's entry level wine and, untouched by oak (just aged in stainless steel), it displays a large sprinkling of minerality: graphite and granite, under the lightest, most agreeable greeny-balsamic touch that adds a good measure of freshness to the wine. There follows the unleashing of a host of violets and hints of earthy undergrowth. Vertical, linear and with perfect acidity is the only way to describe the effect on the palate.A tribute to Dominique's heroic efforts!","Adega Ponte de Boga is situated in “Terra de Caldelas”, a region of outstanding wines made from ancient grape varieties that is blessed by the River Sil coursing through it and protected by the Gran Cañón, which has the effect of regulating temperatures there. This is also a land of terraces, worked in the age-old traditional way, positioned facing the sun, and producing low yields.

It's made with Bordeaux varieties, perfectly adapted to the region and harvested by hand, which are then vinified separately, with the clear objective of obtaining the maximum expressiveness possible from each of them. It exhibits a nose evocative of wild black fruit (blackberries and very ripe blueberries) and ash on a lactic background. Subtle suggestions of toasted almond skin bring to mind restrained oak and the odd hint of orange peel rounds off the ensemble. Its palate is juicy, spicy, with elegant rounded tannins.

Viña Gravonia Blanco Crianza 2015,£35.35,,White wine,Rioja ,Viura,Bodegas R. López de Heredia ,"López de Heredia - Viña Tondonia is particularly well-known and admired for its white wines, and Viña Gravonia is a very good option for getting to know its good work, a first step, and obviously much more affordable and accessible.
Just its appearance, its colour, demonstrates clearly this winery’s exceptional work as true masters in the art of ageing wine: notice how little this white has been evolving; aged for four years in American oak barrels, with a long maturation in bottle until now, and yet it appears a lovely gold colour without evolution.
Viña Gravonia is the house's most modest wine but its complexity is quite remarkable. The first impression on the nose is one of maturity and moisture: wet stones, sea breezes, gentle whiffs of iodine, which come as a surprise to anyone accustomed to lighter, younger whites, but which immediately captivates lovers of mature, complex whites. Swirling it round a little, straightaway it offers a blend of fresh, citrus aromas, with lactic notes (cheese) and ripe fruits, of ripe pear skin and lime blossom tea, with a very pleasant freshness once it becomes still in the glass.
It is dry on the palate: don't expect a sweetish wine with this sort of maturity; its acidity is extraordinary and will enable it to continue evolving over time. The notes suggesting moisture and other aromas discerned on the nose are repeated now on the palate: evolved fruit, raw almonds and notes reminding us of cheese. It is an easy wine to drink, fluid, medium-bodied, a perfect companion for aperitifs and less complex dishes, mushrooms, full-fat cheeses and any mild dish combining these ingredients. Tondonia white wines relate extremely well to food and should be served at virtually the temperature of a red, remember: at about 14-16 degrees, or you will miss out on all its richness! ","R. López de Heredia (Viña Tondonia) is one of the names which inspires most respect and admiration with regard to wineries producing ""fine wine"".

Vinya des Moré Pinot Noir 2012,£25.20,,Red wine,Pla i Llevant ,Pinot Noir,Vins Miquel Gelabert,"The Pinot Noir is a fragile grape and rather elusive, not always easy to cultivate. It's a very noble grape but requires some quite special climatic conditions. It's Burgundy's star variety but we can also find it adapting well to other areas with a more southerly latitude, where it produces very good wines from high altitude parcels or vineyards enjoying a highly favourable location. However, we need to taste them in a different mind-set and not look for a Burgundy wine from them. If you ever get the chance, don't miss out on the one made by Cortijo Los Aguilares in the Serranía de Ronda, at a height of 900 m, or Raül Bobet's in Castell d'Encús, at an altitude of about 1000 m in the Pyrenees area, or this Vinya des Morè, in Mallorca.
Miquel Gelabert is a vine grower who's passionate about his land, a champion of native varieties, because of their singularity and the cultural legacy they convey, yet he also figures among the pioneers in introducing foreign grapes to the island's vineyards. Industrious, he's a man who likes to experiment and surprise consumers with wines full of character. The Pinot Noir also numbers among the thirty-odd varieties he grows and is used to produce this noble wine, Vinya des Morè.
Vinya des Morè is a Mediterranean Pinot Noir, serious and refined like those we find further north. It's also a wine for cellaring, with a tannin presence, a tad dry in the first years, but pleasant, offset well by the juiciness of the fruit, ripe blackberries and plums. It's a wine that will surprise and delight you, leaving an impression, revealing earthy notes, a passage through the mouth that's fresh and uncovers floral and fine oak undertones.

Allende Blanco 2019,£25.00,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Finca Allende,"Allende Blanco is a wine of contrasts, of surprises, pleasant ones, and an ideal white for getting to know the great potential of the Rioja's Viura variety and being delighted with it. The contrasts will become apparent when you compare the nose and palate. And the great surprise, or the second one, comes through on the palate. It's impressive, a white recalling some of those superb Chardonnays from Burgundy but with all the character of a true Rioja: maturity, tension and saline profundity, like some of the classics.  A white that few can compare to, genuinely classic, precisely modern.
The Allende Blanco is almost a single varietal Viura and will ultimately become one in time. It has a mere 5% Malvasía from some vines planted among the Viura, but which Miguel Ángel intends to select and discard over time since, even though it's a variety that imparts aromas when the wine is young, it's quick to oxidise. We will follow the development of this white with great attention.","In the glass it's a very bright yellow, extremely limpid, and once poured, the aromas tally with that lightness of colour: subtly perfumed and tremendously fresh, citrus, with a very clean and well-defined nose, yet also revealing some surprising hints redolent of chalk. Warming up a bit, it develops a saline nuance, a balsamic waft and even a hint of the odd off-white flower. It's definitely not lacking in elegance, character, nor complexity either.
In the mouth it is very flavoursome, with great volume and the fruit provision is delicious, with flavours more of stone fruit than the citrus ones suggested by its nose, peach and very ripe greengage plums. Unless you'd read the technical sheet, you'd never believe that this wine not only ferments in new barrels but also ages in them for over a year, for a total of fourteen months, in French oak barrels and all new. The secret? Barrels with a very light toast. And the Burgundy idea comes to mind due to the overall quality and precision. A great Viura, long and very persistent as well.",,,,"We asked Miguel Ángel about that chalky character in this Rioja Alta region and he told us that the soils of Briones, the town where his vineyards are located, are ones that make the difference; clay soils, yes, but with a continuous substratum of calcareous gravel which makes the roots of those old vines sink down deep and extract a large amount of minerals.",Serve between 10ºC and 12ºC,Starters and suppersVegetablesRiceFishPoultry and white meatsPasta,Contains sulfites,13.5,"25,000 - 35,000  bottles","Miguel Ángel de Gregorio is one of the best winemakers in the country and an assiduous vine grower.

Alcorta Reserva Apasionado 2017,£15.35,,Red wine,Rioja ,Tempranillo,Bodegas Campo Viejo,"Every sip of Alcorta Reserva Apasionado brings with it the warmth of a vintage difficult to forget but without falling into the sensation of a hard, too intense wine. The expertise of the winery both in the vineyards and in the winemaking process has produced a mature wine with expressive aromas and an all-around smooth feeling, while avoiding any excessive tannicity or strength. Don't be fooled by the label's flames — they represent a passion for wine, not an excessive warmth in its taste.
Alcorta Reserva Apasionado is a single-variety Tempranillo wine produced from vineyards planted at high altitudes and under unique conditions. Most vines are over 25 years old and their estate is split into small plots for each grape variety to express itself in the best possible way, bringing all its potential to the firm's wines — including, of course, the Tempranillo used for Alcorta Reserva Apasionado. The resulting wine is barrel-aged for eighteen months, mainly in French oak, before standing for a further eighteen months in the bottle to gain in complexity and roundness.
A splendid Picota cherry colour in the glass is transparent enough to allow the light to highlight its more reddish glints. Aromas of cherries and ripe plums abound, as well as dust, warm spices, and a fine hint of cocoa. It offers subtle sensations of liqueur in the mouth wrapped in refreshing acidity and a level of tannicity which is neither discrete nor excessive. In fact, the bitterness of the tannins are what make the wine a perfect companion for red meat with its fats and proteins. To enjoy it fully, it is worth decanting first and waiting patiently to make the most of the wine's more smoothing touches of mint and bay leaves. ","Campo Viejo is one of the Rioja region's most well-established names and produces on its premises three premium brands that sell in over 70 countries: Campo Viejo, Azpilicueta and Alcorta.

With this idea of 'completeness', three dimensions which can reach perfection when united, although each one on its own forms part of the whole, Winery Arts presents its innovative “Number nine” ('Número Nueve') collection.
Comprising three wines, with each one having its own particular symbolism: Tres al cuadrado (3 squared) represents the physical world; Seis al Revés (6 inverted), the power of thought; and Número Nueve (number 9), the transcendental.
Here 'Tres al Cuadrado', in effect nine, represents the physical world, as was mentioned, the material elements, the real and measurable world: earth, water, sun, wind; and equates to a distinctive, pleasant wine highlighting red fruit, spices and balsamic notes. This is a refined wine in spite of its powerfulness.
An intense cherry-red colour, it is bright and considerably dense in appearance. The fine, elegant nose displays primarily red fruit and spicy aromas, with balsamic notes, giving it a pleasant complexity. The lovely palate, showing great finesse despite its power, has a flavoursome aftertaste focusing on fruit with mineral touches.
Aged for 14 months in French and American one-year oak barrels.","Winery Arts makes its debut in the wine world with an innovative collection of three wines which recall the symbolism of number nine, believed by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom: Tres al Cuadrado, Seis al Revés and Número Nueve, three wines carefully made using grapes originating from a selection of old, low-yielding vineyards and which correspond to three different concepts, three styles, all three essential for reaching the required 'fullness'.

Single varietal wines that show all the strength of the fruit, maintain the impetus of youth and demonstrate their maturity in the way they express themselves thanks to a respectful ageing.
Garnacha By Artazu in its white version is also a commitment to the recouping of Navarra's Garnacha Blanca. A lovely white, made solely using Garnacha Blanca grapes, originating from the vineyards which the winery owns in the town of Artazu, with the vines planted at an altitude of 450-600m on calcareous-clay soils.

Ramón Valle planted the first grapevines between 1930 and 1950, guided by instinct and forming a network of micro-parcels, mainly on slopes, creating a Mencía grape paradise, where work is only possible by hand. The soils of stone and clay, as well as a transitional climate between Atlantic and continental, endow this cellar's wines with great freshness and elegance, because, as Jorge Peique says, 'You have to take great care of a wine if it bears your family name; it's one of the things to feel most proud of'.
This Mencia wine is produced with grapes from 70-90 year old family owned grapevines. It is then aged for 18 months in new French oak barrels before standing for a further 15 months in the bottle.

Bàrbara Forés El Templari 2018,£19.45,,Red wine,Terra Alta ,Morenillo,Celler Bàrbara Forés ,"El Templari is the result of years working with and getting to know the Morenillo variety, firstly blending it with the Grenache as a partner, before taking the leap to produce a single-variety wine. Bottled for the first time in 2018 by the Bàrbara Forés winery, the new El Templari expresses all the qualities this interesting variety can offer. Ageing in clay, rather than wood, rounds the wine and emphasizes its mineral and fruity aspects. The work of local cellars such as Bàrbara Forés in Gandesa or Celler Piñol in Batea since the end of the 1990s has saved this late-ripening variety from disappearing as many feared it would. Thanks to their efforts, Morenillo has finally been classified this year as one of the authorized grapes under the DO Terra Alta label.
As the winery explains, they have recovered the traditional red colour of some Catalan wines with El Templari. Less dark than more burgundy-coloured wines, it has a wonderfully lively crimson colour. Clear, honest aromas of soil, blackberries, and carob beans delight the nose, with hints of peach and mandarins appearing after a short time in the glass. In the mouth, pleasant lactic sensations blend with the acidity of red fruits of the forest and elegant, lightly bitter vegetal touches. With liqueurish hints, it is both an intense but gentle wine, juicy and tannic. Its lingering floral, saline and freshly soothing aftertaste is slow to fade and together with its wonderful balance makes it hard to put down after the first sip. A wine which does not call for a special moment or event; created from the heart and brimming with typicity and character, it is an ideal drink for enjoying any time, any place.
What is more, if you can decant it and leave it to stand for a couple of hours it improves even more so. Serving it a couple of degrees cooler than usual for red wines will highlight the wilder and more floral side to its profile.",,Picota cherry red / Intense,Fruit aromas / Ripe red fruit / Undergrowth notes,Balanced / Good acidity / Ripe fruit / Silky tannins,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.5,,,Continental with Mediterranean influence,,,,,,,,,,,,4.2,6,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/templ18_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/barbara-fores-el-templari/,2018.0,

Callejuela Oloroso El Cerro (0.5 L),£54.65,,Oloroso sherry,Jerez-Manzanilla ,Palomino Fino,Callejuela,"The Oloroso El Cerro, amongst the oldest and most special wines made by Bodega Callejuela, obtained the distinction of being named the best fortified wine of 2015 by El Mundo Vino. It's a wine that had already started its formation when Francisco Blanco was running the winery: it's over 20 years old. The grapes come from the estate vineyards surrounding the winery. It's bottled en rama (in as natural a state as possible) with minimal filtration.
On the nose it's generous and rich in fruit aromas (figs, dates and dried apricots), caramel and beeswax. Hints of leather, toasted almonds and warm spices like vanilla and cinnamon. On the palate it's intense, with a perfect balance between acidity and sweetness. The spices become cooler, now evocative of cloves and pepper. The oak comes out in a toasty and subtly caramel finish.","The history of Bodega Callejuela dates back to around 1980, when Francisco Blanco Martínez, descended from vine growers and having 20 years of experience in the wine world, began producing artisan grape juice to sell to other wineries and small quantities of wine for personal consumption.

Francisco, father of the current managers, started at that time to buy vineyards in the Marco de Jerez region.

Valtravieso Rupture 2018,£29.90,,Red wine,Castile and León ,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot",Bodegas y Viñedos Valtravieso,"Valtravieso and quality are two words that have gone hand in hand since the winery's beginnings, around 1985. Meticulous care of the limestone vineyards lying at an altitude of more than 900 metres ensures outstanding quality, vintage after vintage.
At the winery, an expert team tastes samples to decide on the blends of each wine. During one of these sessions, in April 2015, something unusual and quite extraordinary happened: a wine made of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon stood out above the rest. This was how Valtravieso Rupture came into being, a wine that naturally broke with the rules laid down by the Ribera del Duero DO's regulating council, but which reflects all the intensity of the Castilian terroir.
It appears an attractive cherry colour with a dignified nose. Featuring among its aromas are lovely wild fruit (redcurrants and raspberries), spices such as cloves and the refined toasting of top-notch wood. The customary peppery hints so frequently found among wines made from Cabernet and Merlot, away from their native Bordeaux, become yet another aromatic factor, which most definitely adds complexity to the ensemble.
On the palate, it's lively and intense from start to finish, with a perfect balance between the delightful acidity of the red fruits and the smoky and chocolaty nuances acquired from the barrel. It brings to mind Picota cherry skin, violets and tobacco leaf, and its vigorous but well-integrated tannins augur a great future; it's already a superb wine but will continue to evolve in bottle.","Valtravieso started up in 1985 on an estate called La Revilla, located in the Valladolid town of Pinel de Arriba, right in the heart of the Ribera del Duero. It was here that the first experimental grapevines were planted and the first vintage to be put on the market was the 1994, which was their Crianza. However, it wasn't until the González Beteré family acquired the property in 2002 that Valtravieso's wines really got underway.

Tres Patas 2018,£18.50,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Canopy,"Created with aromatic grapes grown at a height of 750 metres in a micro-climate of high daytime temperatures and cool nights, Tres Patas is an excellent award-winning wine like most wines from the Canopy winery. After the harvest, the grapes undergo a pre-fermentation maceration at controlled temperatures. The alcoholic fermentation then lasts 15 days, followed by a malolactic fermentation in barrels and 12 months ageing in French oak 400 and 500-litre barrels and larger 1,500-litre foudres. Finally it is bottled unfiltered and unclarified.
The resulting wine has a dark Picota cherry red colour with fragile reddish edges. The first sensations to hit the nose are aromas of very ripe fruit (black plums) with citrus hints promising a fresher mouth than originally expected. Aromas of pepper and anise appear, accompanied by soothing notes of dry leaves and preserved olive brine. The first sip reveals a wine which may seem shy but quickly fills the mouth with juicy fruit and toasted flavours. Its acidity pinches at your cheeks while bitter yet elegant hints of dark chocolate delight the palate. Tres Patas has a versatility rarely seen in a red wine – ideal for drinking alone, or paired with steak or even a homemade stew with pulses. However you choose to drink it, we believe you won't regret it.","Bodegas Canopy is a project which brings together Belarmino Fernández, Jordi Vidal and Alfonso Chacón, three winemaker friends, professionals in the world of wine, business and catering, who decided one day to put their efforts and passion into a wine-growing venture which would enable them to rediscover the historic terrain of the Méntrida denomination, an area that did not enjoy a very good reputation, specialising as it had done for ages in producing bulk wine and with very...",Picota cherry red / Quite intense / Clean / Bright,Fragrant / Fruit aromas / Red fruit / Mineral notes / Spicy notes / Hardwoods / Floral scents,Medium-bodied / With volume / Succulent / Fleshy / Fresh / Pleasant finish / Refreshing / Intense / Persistent,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,,,Wood,12 months,New and semi-new,French oak,Unfiltered,,,54 years,Silica / Limestone,Mediterranean with continental influence,,,4.3,3,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/trpat18_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/tres-patas/,2018.0,

Gramona Vi de Glass Riesling (0.37 L),£19.10,,Icewine,Penedès ,Riesling,Gramona,"Gramona created its Vi de Glass range in 1997, seeking the essence of the grape and modelling its products on the delightful German ice wines, the famous Eiswein. They are naturally concentrated sweet wines which differ from Eiswein, mainly due to the fact that freezing doesn't take place in the vineyard but in the winery, in special chambers, in the same way as state-of-the-art kitchens in prestigious restaurants use nitrogen for their intricate gastronomic creations.
Aiming to express all the grape's essence, Gramona makes its Vi de Glass Riesling with grapes gathered late, which freeze in two chambers that operate at a temperature of -15ºC with the help of liquid nitrogen. This favours a speedy freezing of the grapes and results in uniformity. The must ferments for a longer period of time than usual, for two and a half months, due to the high concentration of sugar and this whole process leads to a fruity and very concentrated wine, both sweet and refreshing, rich in exotic aromas, which will continue ageing forever in the thick, dark, glass bottle especially designed to safeguard its maturing. 
Vi de Glass Riesling is a sweet wine of great aromatic expressivity; on the nose, its fruitiness is predominant (citrus fruits, mandarins, pineapple and pear) as well as a floral character, on a subtle background of honey and aromatic herbs. On the palate, it offers a pleasant entry and a silky, unctuous passage through the mouth, with a very refreshing finish which offsets the sweetness that doesn't make it cloying. It proves an ideal mid-afternoon wine, if opened while still young, or to serve with fruit cocktails, truffles... a dessert wine, naturally; but also perfect to put with strong cheeses, pâtés..., as it becomes more mature.
","Gramona is one of the most renowned wineries in the Cava sector and possesses a long tradition dating back to 1850. Located in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, its products succeed in expressing all the elegance and identity of a markedly Mediterranean terroir and are distinguished by the excellence accruing from the lengthy ageing periods spent in bottle, the common denominator found in the world's finest sparkling wines.

La Carrerada 2015,£48.60,,Red wine,Montsant ,Cariñena,Orto Vins ,"La Carrerada is one of the Orto Vins ‘singularidades’ – from their ‘singular wine collection’ of single varietals. This one belongs to the Jové-Casals family, with Josep Maria Jové one of the winery’s associate vinegrowers. The estate is located in the Les Sorts district, within the municipality of El Masroig, on a vast plain situated on the right-hand bank of the River Siurana, a much sought-after area from a wine-growing perspective, due to the prefect maturity reached by the Cariñena grapes.
The estate only covers 1.3 ha, with the land divided up into two strips: one is set out on terraces, over a surface area of 0.55 hectares, and was planted back in 1978; the other lies on a gentle slope over 0.74 hectares, with vines planted in 1936 and 1956. They select the best grapes from the second plot to make this single varietal, ‘singular’ wine. (Production for the 2009 vintage stands at a mere 659 bottles.)
La Carrerada is the youngest ‘singularidad’ from Orto Vins: 2009 has been its first vintage; a concentrated but restrained wine, muscular and full of nuances. A wine that requires a bit of time.","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens. They have followed in the vine-growing footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, with a long tradition of working in cooperatives, and in 2008 they decided to start up their own winery and make top quality wines.

Pla dels Àngels de Scala Dei 2021,£32.75,,Rosé wine,Priorat ,Garnacha,Celler Scala Dei,"This rosé wine will leave its mark on you. It deserves a place among the great wines — not just among its peers, but also up alongside all the great red and white wines. The Pla dels Angels is an excellent wine — complex, fresh, refined, extremely versatile, and also perfect for drinking on its own. Pure pleasure and seduction.
Produced with the 2014 harvest by the experienced hands of Ricard Rofes, who is in charge of the new direction taken by this pioneering celler in the Priorat, the Pla dels Angels wine is made with fruit from one plot. The Pla dels Angels plot is a Grenache vineyard in clay soils at an altitude of 500-600 metres. The characteristics here are completely different from those which we are used to seeing in the Priorat. Here the Grenache vines grow in a triply fresh environment thanks to the altitude, the soil, and the viticulture techniques, developed to avoid overripening of the fruit.
Its pale pink colour in the glass gives a clue to its delicateness, but fools us with regards to its intensity. This rosé wine has a strong impact on the nose, and especially in the mouth. A remarkable strength and intensity, unctuous but lively, fresh, balanced, and extremely fine at the same time.

Allende Blanco 2019,£25.00,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Finca Allende,"Allende Blanco is a wine of contrasts, of surprises, pleasant ones, and an ideal white for getting to know the great potential of the Rioja's Viura variety and being delighted with it. The contrasts will become apparent when you compare the nose and palate. And the great surprise, or the second one, comes through on the palate. It's impressive, a white recalling some of those superb Chardonnays from Burgundy but with all the character of a true Rioja: maturity, tension and saline profundity, like some of the classics.  A white that few can compare to, genuinely classic, precisely modern.
The Allende Blanco is almost a single varietal Viura and will ultimately become one in time. It has a mere 5% Malvasía from some vines planted among the Viura, but which Miguel Ángel intends to select and discard over time since, even though it's a variety that imparts aromas when the wine is young, it's quick to oxidise. We will follow the development of this white with great attention.","In the glass it's a very bright yellow, extremely limpid, and once poured, the aromas tally with that lightness of colour: subtly perfumed and tremendously fresh, citrus, with a very clean and well-defined nose, yet also revealing some surprising hints redolent of chalk. Warming up a bit, it develops a saline nuance, a balsamic waft and even a hint of the odd off-white flower. It's definitely not lacking in elegance, character, nor complexity either.
In the mouth it is very flavoursome, with great volume and the fruit provision is delicious, with flavours more of stone fruit than the citrus ones suggested by its nose, peach and very ripe greengage plums. Unless you'd read the technical sheet, you'd never believe that this wine not only ferments in new barrels but also ages in them for over a year, for a total of fourteen months, in French oak barrels and all new. The secret? Barrels with a very light toast. And the Burgundy idea comes to mind due to the overall quality and precision. A great Viura, long and very persistent as well.",,,,"We asked Miguel Ángel about that chalky character in this Rioja Alta region and he told us that the soils of Briones, the town where his vineyards are located, are ones that make the difference; clay soils, yes, but with a continuous substratum of calcareous gravel which makes the roots of those old vines sink down deep and extract a large amount of minerals.",Serve between 10ºC and 12ºC,Starters and suppersVegetablesRiceFishPoultry and white meatsPasta,Contains sulfites,13.5,"25,000 - 35,000  bottles","Miguel Ángel de Gregorio is one of the best winemakers in the country and an assiduous vine grower.

Peique Viñedos Viejos 2018,£19.10,,Red wine,Bierzo ,Mencia,Bodegas Peique,"Vine growing and wine making run in the Peique family. Ramón Valle planted the first grapevines between 1930 and 1950, guided by instinct and forming a network of micro-parcels, mainly on slopes, creating a Mencía grape paradise, where work is only possible by hand. The soils of stone and clay, as well as a transitional climate between Atlantic and continental, endow this cellar's wines, and especially its Viñedos Viejos, with great freshness and elegance.
Matured for 12 months in French oak barrels and with a further 12 months of repose in bottle, the Peique Viñedos Viejos is a red that's elegant, with ripe black fruit, tobacco notes, leather and paprika, ample and flavoursome on the palate, sophisticated, with a velvety feel...: A Bierzo in the classic style.","For many years, the Mencia wines of the Bierzo appellation didn't manage to achieve recognition as top-quality wines.

Also that ""Making a great wine is tantamount to artistry"". Whether their wines are great or not will fall to the individual palate to decide, but their fine work is to be admired and their wines are undoubtedly delightful and show great personality, finding favour with all those who have the chance to try them (even down to their labels, simple but with a very cleverly executed design and motif).
This is a small, family-run winery, yet with a deep-rooted tradition in wine growing; they have an in-depth knowledge of their 9 hectares of vineyards, where some of the vines they grow are almost 100 years old, and they are well aware that only from hard work entailing due consideration, effort and perseverance can they ever expect to harvest excellent grapes, of the Tinta del País variety, which are used for making their three ‘parcel’ wines (Valdepalacios, San Miguel and La Nava) and their two ‘coupage’ wines: Selección and Roble.
The distinctive character of their wines comes as the biggest surprise: their Yotuel Selección is notable for its intriguing Bordeaux touch, and their Yotuel Roble, which we are offering here, for its minerality; it is one of those wines difficult to place at a blind tasting and an excellent terroir wine in its price bracket. It comes as no surprise that the quantity produced runs out in no time at all! 
This ""little number"" from Gallego Zapatero is a lively wine, appearing an attractive colour in the glass, clean and bright. It is full-on fruity on the nose (and palate too), pleasant, oily, with spicy notes (pepper) and a definite rustic feel, and it does surprise, as was mentioned before, with its minerality and balsamic notes.
On the palate it is a fruit-forward wine, fleshy, juicy, with sweet notes, rounded, balanced, with good structure and body; an extremely pleasant wine, that finishes with some subtle, polished ageing notes to round off the aftertaste. A wine to pour into the glass, drink and thoroughly enjoy. Cheers!","Bodegas y Viñedos Gallego Zapatero is a family-run winery with a deep-rooted tradition in grape growing.

Even from appearance, its density with its Picota cherry colour and blueish tears tinting the glass, prepare us for a memorable experience. An expressive nose emits aromas of blueberries and blackberries complementing mineral ones, as well as hints of tobacco and chocolate.

The Sierra Cantabria Colección Privada is a wine that has been cherished from start to finish, from a meticulous selection of the bunches to its artisanal production methods, with endless fine details taken into consideration, such as type of bottle, label... The grapes, exclusively of the Tempranillo variety, come from vineyard estates over fifty years old, the Los Terreros and Jararte fincas, in San Vicente de la Sonsierra, and the wine is made in equal measures both traditionally, with destemmed bunches, and by means of carbonic maceration. Likewise in the ageing process, tradition is wisely combined with modern procedures: half of the wine is aged in French oak barrels and the other half in American oak barrels, all new, for a long maturation period of 16 months.
It's a wine which swiftly enchants all those who try it, since it combines robustness and density, refinement and roundness, a wine that is subtle, pure, very fruity and succulent. Appearing a deep cherry colour in the glass, it is very expressive on the nose, and intense and concentrated on the palate, with creamy and toasty aromas integrating well with the fruitiness of that almost jammy fruit, picked when just slightly overripe.
A structured, very fine Rioja wine, with rounded tannins and a ripe-fruit base which has admirably long length. In short, a wine with personality which manages to fuse like few others Rioja's wine history and its winery's modernity.","Viñedos Sierra Cantabria is essentially a collection of vineyards that the Eguren family has brought together as part of their Sierra Cantabria wine range featuring new classics. These exceptional wines primarily showcase the Tempranillo grape and represent the particular characteristics of their terroir: Colección Privada, Sierra Cantabria Cuvée, Organza, and the renowned Amancio and El Bosque.

NOTE: The Rafa Bernabé wines have been produced with minimum intervention, vinified with hardly any handling and in the most natural way possible, without the addition of sulphur and with yeasts from the actual vineyard, and they have not been clarified or filtered.

Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva Blanco 2001,£126.50,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Bodegas R. López de Heredia ,"Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva wines are very rich and elegant, eminently appealing and satisfying. Their lengthy ageing, lasting ten years, with racking carried out by hand twice a year, endows them with certain special characteristics that make them particularly long-lived; these are wines which, if they have been kept well, can be enjoyed after a period of many, many years.
If drinking a Gran Reserva from Viña Tondonia really is a little luxury and having a bottle in the cellar equates to owning treasure, being able to get hold of one of their most memorable vintages is a real privilege, within reach of few, and not just because of its price: Viña Tondonia only offers its historic wines to a very small number of customers, rewarding their loyalty, and this occurs on rare occasions when a very limited number of bottles are secured.
-----------------------------------
Storage conditions for the historic wines now available from Vinissimus
Vinissimus would like to inform its customers that bottles of the historic vintages of Viña Tondonia and Viña Bosconia are not being stored in our fine wine cellar but in the actual underground cellars of Bodegas R. López de Heredia, in Haro (La Rioja), the best guarantee that the wine has always been kept in optimum conditions.
Bottles will only leave the winery in Haro to be sent to customers who have requested them in their Vinissimus orders, in special packaging deemed fit by the actual winery, so that the best possible care is taken of them during transit.
Information about the characteristics of the bottles and returns guarantee
A customer who purchases one of these historic bottles should be aware that the wine and bottle are very special, with no entitlement to a refund.
Since the bottles have been resting in the winery's cellars for many years, at a constant temperature with high humidity, not only can they acquire mould and dust, but this will be left on the bottles, and they will be dispatched exactly as they are, in their natural state, as an additional proof of their true age.
Moreover, due to the fact that these bottles have been filled by hand and have been ageing over a long period of time, the height of the wine in the bottle neck is always irregular, even including wines from the same vintage. These wines have been bottled, sealed and labelled by hand.
Returns will only be accepted in the case of bottles verified as corked and the defect will need confirmation from the winery itself. In such an eventuality, the customer should send back the bottle with its contents, cork and original packaging, to the address as notified by Vinissimus. A new bottle will be sent out, only if the defect is confirmed by the winery.
Recommendations for enjoying a historic wine
After you have received the wine, you should allow it to settle for at least a week, preferably in a quiet, dark, cool place. The storage temperature and humidity should be constant. Humidity between 70-80% and temperature between 18-20º C.
If you decide to decant the wine, we recommend doing this carefully and allowing the wine to settle in the decanter for at least an hour before serving. Take great care when pouring, trying not to move the decanter unduly.
If you decide not to decant, we also recommend letting the bottle settle by keeping it vertical for an hour, so that any possible sediment remains at the bottom. Care should be taken when opening the bottle, since a cork may lose its elasticity over the years. Pour the wine with care, ensuring minimal movement of the bottle.","R.

Amancio 2019,£126.50,,Red wine,Rioja ,Tempranillo,Viñedos Sierra Cantabria,"Amancio, named after the founder of the Eguren family dynasty, is a modern-style, single vineyard wine that achieves the objective of extracting maximum expression from the Tempranillo grape. Included in a special collection produced at their newly constructed winery, Viñedos Sierra Cantabria, it epitomises the new classic, combining potent fruit and expression of vine origin with the elegance and freshness of a traditional Rioja wine.
Amancio wines originate from the La Veguilla vineyard in the district of San Vicente de la Sonsierra. The Tempranillo vines, aged between 20-35 years old, catch the morning sun on a slope facing south-east, sheltered from harsh elements by the Sierra Cantabria mountains.
Due to an extremely rigorous selection process at harvest, only clusters in perfect condition are hand-picked. Destemming with further sorting is carried out manually, before fermentation in 500-litre French oak barrels and in a couple of 1,000-litre capacity French oak tanks, with pressing by foot carried out twice daily. Effectively, this wine undergoes a ‘200% new barrel’ treatment, with both malolactic fermentation and 24 months of ageing in different new French oak Bordelaise barrels.
Deep cherry-red in colour, the nose is full of character and complexity, with aromas of ripe dark fruit and spicy notes. On the palate, this wine is powerful and flavoursome with rounded tannins and a lingering finish - simply outstanding and consistently very highly rated.","Viñedos Sierra Cantabria is essentially a collection of vineyards that the Eguren family has brought together as part of their Sierra Cantabria wine range featuring new classics.

Tres Patas 2018,£18.50,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Canopy,"Created with aromatic grapes grown at a height of 750 metres in a micro-climate of high daytime temperatures and cool nights, Tres Patas is an excellent award-winning wine like most wines from the Canopy winery. After the harvest, the grapes undergo a pre-fermentation maceration at controlled temperatures. The alcoholic fermentation then lasts 15 days, followed by a malolactic fermentation in barrels and 12 months ageing in French oak 400 and 500-litre barrels and larger 1,500-litre foudres. Finally it is bottled unfiltered and unclarified.
The resulting wine has a dark Picota cherry red colour with fragile reddish edges. The first sensations to hit the nose are aromas of very ripe fruit (black plums) with citrus hints promising a fresher mouth than originally expected. Aromas of pepper and anise appear, accompanied by soothing notes of dry leaves and preserved olive brine. The first sip reveals a wine which may seem shy but quickly fills the mouth with juicy fruit and toasted flavours. Its acidity pinches at your cheeks while bitter yet elegant hints of dark chocolate delight the palate. Tres Patas has a versatility rarely seen in a red wine – ideal for drinking alone, or paired with steak or even a homemade stew with pulses. However you choose to drink it, we believe you won't regret it.","Bodegas Canopy is a project which brings together Belarmino Fernández, Jordi Vidal and Alfonso Chacón, three winemaker friends, professionals in the world of wine, business and catering, who decided one day to put their efforts and passion into a wine-growing venture which would enable them to rediscover the historic terrain of the Méntrida denomination, an area that did not enjoy a very good reputation, specialising as it had done for ages in producing bulk wine and with very...",Picota cherry red / Quite intense / Clean / Bright,Fragrant / Fruit aromas / Red fruit / Mineral notes / Spicy notes / Hardwoods / Floral scents,Medium-bodied / With volume / Succulent / Fleshy / Fresh / Pleasant finish / Refreshing / Intense / Persistent,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,,,Wood,12 months,New and semi-new,French oak,Unfiltered,,,54 years,Silica / Limestone,Mediterranean with continental influence,,,4.3,3,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/trpat18_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/tres-patas/,2018.0,

Dominio del Águila Peñas Aladas Gran Reserva 2015,£196.80,,Red wine,Ribera del Duero ,"Tempranillo, Albillo, Bruñal",Dominio del Águila,"Peñas Aladas is the most exclusive wine from Dominio del Águila, a winery widely-praised by specialist media in recent years. A wonderful Gran Reserva, it is produced with grapes collected from the small 85-year-old Peñas Aladas plot located in the village of La Aguilera.
Most of the vines are Tempranillo ones but other varieties such as Bruñal or Albillo make up around 15% of the total. With their firm commitment to maintaining traditional techniques, whole bunches of grapes are crushed together without destemming in traditional vats known as lagars. The must is then fermented in stainless steel with local yeasts before being transferred to French oak barrels to undergo a malolactic fermentation and 51 months' ageing in cool underground cellars at the winery. This slow and careful process rounds the wine off perfectly and gives it an amazing complexity.
It has a suggestive cherry-red colour and a seductive nose brimming with pure fragrances of violets, wild berries and exotic spices. It is complex and mature in the mouth, with a silky palate, elegant tannins and an austere minerality. An often sought-after but rarely-found freshness and elegance make it a perfectly-balanced wine with an irresistible personality. With a limited production of only one thousand bottles, Peñas Aladas is an exclusive treasure and undoubtedly a new icon in the world of Ribera del Duero wines.    ","Founded in 2010, Dominio del Águila is where Jorge Monzón and Isabel Rodero’s dream of creating elegant and pure wines has come true.

Bàrbara Forés El Templari 2018,£19.45,,Red wine,Terra Alta ,Morenillo,Celler Bàrbara Forés ,"El Templari is the result of years working with and getting to know the Morenillo variety, firstly blending it with the Grenache as a partner, before taking the leap to produce a single-variety wine. Bottled for the first time in 2018 by the Bàrbara Forés winery, the new El Templari expresses all the qualities this interesting variety can offer. Ageing in clay, rather than wood, rounds the wine and emphasizes its mineral and fruity aspects. The work of local cellars such as Bàrbara Forés in Gandesa or Celler Piñol in Batea since the end of the 1990s has saved this late-ripening variety from disappearing as many feared it would. Thanks to their efforts, Morenillo has finally been classified this year as one of the authorized grapes under the DO Terra Alta label.
As the winery explains, they have recovered the traditional red colour of some Catalan wines with El Templari. Less dark than more burgundy-coloured wines, it has a wonderfully lively crimson colour. Clear, honest aromas of soil, blackberries, and carob beans delight the nose, with hints of peach and mandarins appearing after a short time in the glass. In the mouth, pleasant lactic sensations blend with the acidity of red fruits of the forest and elegant, lightly bitter vegetal touches. With liqueurish hints, it is both an intense but gentle wine, juicy and tannic. Its lingering floral, saline and freshly soothing aftertaste is slow to fade and together with its wonderful balance makes it hard to put down after the first sip. A wine which does not call for a special moment or event; created from the heart and brimming with typicity and character, it is an ideal drink for enjoying any time, any place.
What is more, if you can decant it and leave it to stand for a couple of hours it improves even more so.

Aljibes Cabernet Franc 2016,£15.50,,Red wine,Castilla ,Cabernet Franc,Bodegas los Aljibes,"There's no denying that finding a single varietal is no easy task and even more so when looking for one that's both pleasant and expressive. Aljibes Cabernet Franc fulfils all these requirements, a silky and delicate single varietal from La Mancha.
Bodega Los Aljibes is housed in a building that's in the typical La Mancha style, surrounded by 178 hectares of vineyards, at a height of almost a thousand metres. In fact, this is a determining factor in the style of its wines; the strong contrast in day and night temperatures due to the altitude enables a slow maturation which enhances the aromatic element and freshness of the wines. The land is poor in organic matter, with high levels of limestone which confer an extra degree of elegance on the wine.
Even at first sight there's evidence of less extraction than in other Cabernet Francs, as it appears an intense colour but of medium density. On the nose, delicate liqueur notes are revealed with floral and spicy aromas. The palate is restrained as regards the tannic element, as the varietal dictates; fresh, juicy and balsamic, with sweet tannins. Toasty nuances emerge, smoky touches and aromas of olive paste, cooled down by mineral notes and hints of recently cut grass. Rounded, complex yet very easy to figure out, a first-rate gateway to the world of the Cabernet Franc.","The winery is located in the centre of the Finca Los Aljibes estate, at Chinchilla de Montearagón (Albacete), and surrounded by 178 hectares of vineyards at an altitude of almost one thousand metres. The area comes under the Vino de la Tierra de Castilla denomination.

De Muller Aureo Dulce Añejo,£26.00,,Vino rancio,Tarragona ,"Garnacha, White Grenache",De Muller,"A delicious, semi-sweet wine, with a myriad of aromas, unctuous and very pleasant on the palate, ideal both to start off a meal, accompanied by fresh cheese or foie gras, and also to end it, with its characteristic mellow, concentrated taste, as a perfect companion for dried fruits and nuts or Christmas sweetmeats.
Wines of this type are produced from the Garnacha Blanca and Tinta varieties, typical of the Tarragona area, and matured using the solera system. They were not only praised by the Roman emperors, who appreciated their silky and velvety palate, but they are also part of the history of the De Muller winery, which is especially well-known, and internationally too, for the production of rancio (darkish, oxidised, fortified) and sweet wines.
An impressive wine as regards its colour and sensational both on the nose and on the palate, with a rancio touch which greatly enhances it, a fine attribute which one only comes across in small, artisan wineries like De Muller.
NOTE: Since this is a fortified wine, sediment may appear over time. It is advisable to keep the bottle upright and not to shake it.
In appearance, the wine is an amber colour with mahogany tones. It is sophisticated and complex on the nose, with notes of candied fruit, honey, dried fruits and nuts, high roast and the typical ‘rancio’ whiff. It is powerful, rich, full and unctuous on the palate, also fruity and agreeably sweet, with flavours of prunes, raisins, dried figs and honey. The finish is warm and pleasant, and the aftertaste has high roast notes.
Matured in old oak casks using the solera system.","A winery with a history, founded in 1851 by Don Augusto de Muller and Ruinart de Brimont, a wine producer originally from Alsace, and supplier to the Vatican of altar wines from the time of Pope Pius X until Pope John XXIII.

Avanthia Rosé 2014,£16.70,,Oak-aged Rosé Wine,Valdeorras ,Mencia,Bodegas Avanthia,"This rosé is like a young maiden whose purity and sweetness will seduce you. She comes from a good family, as we commonly say, she is educated and has a promising future; or, to translate into wine language: it is made by experienced producers from top quality Mencía grapes, grown on steep slopes in the vicinity of O Barco de Valdeorras, and cared for by expert hands. The result, judge for yourselves: simply adorable.
Avanthia Rosé is tastefully dressed: a lovely redcurrant colour, lively and bright. On the nose, it is natural and genuine. Best not served very cold, you will notice how it releases all its aromas in the glass after a bit of time and air: fresh aromas, with citrus notes, really fresh fruit and touches of shelled almonds and subtle nuances of fresh new wood (Please note! We're not talking of barrels, or vanilla, but a smell you get when you come across a carpenter at work: that smell of wood shavings, a subtle but interesting background).
Now taste it: it's like biting into fresh grapes, the nearest thing to grape juice, without any decoration, a smooth texture, lively and fresh, which caresses the palate whilst also displaying intensity, sinew and volume; this is a wine that gains in density and vigour with every minute spent in the glass, without straying from that line of finesse and delicacy. It is sweetish but shows very good acidity; a rosé that is most inviting to drink and totally moreish too. It has some viscosity, an oily feel, sweet-tasting, like taking a mouthful of fresh strawberry, a wine which despite being light and delicate is chewable too. Quite simply, delightful.  ","The Bodegas Avanthia winery is located on the slate soil hillsides of the area of Valdeorras in Galicia. The name of this area comes from the fact that Romans mined gold here (Val-de-oras roughly means 'golden valley' in Latin).

Their new wine is named after them, and is made using Callet (90%) and Fogoneu grapes, from vines aged between 40 and 50 years old, grown organically, with minimum intervention, in clay loam soils on the Vinya Petita (0.34 ha) and Vinya Ermassos (0.6 ha) estates. Their purpose here is to offer us their own individual interpretation of the Callet: a grape rich in sensations of violets and mineral notes (particularly phosphorous). A wine that is very fresh, subtle, refined and complete.
It may be a little pricier than some, but its limited production, of 1,000 bottles, doesn’t allow much time for thinking it over. ","Francesc Grimalt and Sergio Caballero are the two partners in this bodega, producing wines under the geographical indication of Vino de la Tierra de Mallorca, with a passionate and overriding belief in quality without the need for a huge financial commitment: '4 kilos' alludes to the modest initial investment of 4 million pesetas.

El Médico 2015,£21.30,,Red wine,Castile and León ,Prieto Picudo,Leyenda del Páramo,"El Médico is one of the star wines made by Bodega Leyenda del Páramo, in Valdevimbre, León. Founded in 2010, it came into being because a group of wine-lovers wanted to recover the region's indigenous varieties: the Prieto Picudo and the Albarín Blanco. The vines enjoy the freshness provided by the altitude (900 m), on a site on the northern stretch of the Duero basin, and endure poor quality, pebbly soils; the combination of both factors means that the Leyenda del Páramo wines are as fresh as they are intense.
In the production of El Médico, only Prieto Picudo grapes are used from vines aged more than 60 years old, trained using the local, traditional system: the rastra (with the vine branches trailing on the ground). Harvesting is carried out by hand, with the grapes placed into small, 20-kg crates, and after a careful selection, they undergo a cold pre-maceration for 24 hours and ferment at a controlled temperature. This is followed by malolactic fermentation and afterwards ageing takes place in new and second-use oak barrels.
Tasting a wine made from a minority variety is always a pleasant experience, and even more so when one comes across not only a surprising aromatic array but also a quality not expected. El Médico undoubtedly falls into this category. Right at the start, its lovely purple colour attracts attention. Its tears seem unwilling to glide down the glass and its nose of strawberries and lactic notes are immediately delightful. Forest fruits, blue flowers (lilies) and very fine spices epitomise the aromas of a wine that's very clean-cut, almost chiselled. In spite of its discreet entrance, it grows on the palate in response to a notable acidity that brings to mind ripe blackcurrants. Its mouthfeel is fluid and lively, and touches of paprika and eucalyptus raise it to remarkable levels of freshness and elegance. Ample, balanced and having a restrained and elegant finish in which the oak is simply hinted at, making it easy to continue drinking, sip after sip, and always giving immense satisfaction in return.",,Garnet / Intense / Purplish glints / Clean / Bright,Fruit aromas / Ripe red fruit / Spicy notes / Balsamic notes / Mineral / Hardwoods,Dry / Fresh / Powerful / Full / Balanced / Persistent,,16ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.5,,,60 years,Clay loam / Pebbles / Gravel surface,,,,,,,,,,,4.8,4,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/medic15_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/el-medico/,2015.0,

Leda Viñas Viejas 2017,£33.35,,Red wine,Castile and León ,Tempranillo,Bodegas Leda,"The grapes for Leda Viñas Viejas come from different Duero Valley estates where, in them all, the Tempranillo is planted in very high concentrations, aiming for low yields and maximum expression of the grape. Once inside the winery, Eduardo García, son of the maestro Mariano García (Vega Sicilia, Mauro, Aalto), oversees the whole production process. Before wines are conveyed to the barrels in order to undergo malolactic fermentation, the grapes from each estate are fermented separately in stainless steel so as to produce a clear-cut profile of every individual location. After an ageing period of almost two years in oak, a mere 8,000 bottles of this gem will see the light of day.
On opening a bottle of Leda Viñas Viejas, we find a Tempranillo made from old vines (between 50 and 100 years old), appearing a stunning Picota cherry colour with violet hues on the rim. It looks simply lovely, already a winner, showing plenty of slow, tinted tears. The first sensation on the nose is extremely fresh and intense, very balsamic, with hints of liquorice and eucalyptus. The aromas of very ripe red and black fruit take pride of place overall, complemented by suggestions of white pepper, vanilla, coffee, toasty oak touches and India ink hints that indicate minerality. On the palate, its firm yet polished tannins offer a wonderful dash of fine cocoa. It's powerful and elegant, not an easy combination to obtain, something only reserved for great wines. It's rounded, having fullness and depth, concentrated and packed with nuances. It's aftertaste lasts for minutes and it lingers long inside the mouth. Definitely a magnificent wine that makes a lasting impression.","The Leda project was established in 1998 and among those who founded it were the two sons of the famous oenologist Mariano García: Alberto García and Eduardo García.
The winery is located in the town of Tudela de Duero's old quarter, in a big old 18th Century house that has been completely renovated. The winery's work philosophy is based on viticulture that respects the environment and on quality above all else.

NOTE: Decanting is recommended before serving.

This wine is a dark cherry colour, very dense and has ruby hues on the rim. It offers a complex nose, revealing notes of cocoa, coffee liqueur, cedar-wood, black fruit, balsamic aromas and mineral hints. It is generous, elegant, fleshy and subtle on the palate, showing traces of fine oak, black plums, blueberries and toasty notes, and comes over as smooth, fresh and well-balanced.

Viña Gravonia Blanco Crianza 2015,£35.35,,White wine,Rioja ,Viura,Bodegas R. López de Heredia ,"López de Heredia - Viña Tondonia is particularly well-known and admired for its white wines, and Viña Gravonia is a very good option for getting to know its good work, a first step, and obviously much more affordable and accessible.
Just its appearance, its colour, demonstrates clearly this winery’s exceptional work as true masters in the art of ageing wine: notice how little this white has been evolving; aged for four years in American oak barrels, with a long maturation in bottle until now, and yet it appears a lovely gold colour without evolution.
Viña Gravonia is the house's most modest wine but its complexity is quite remarkable. The first impression on the nose is one of maturity and moisture: wet stones, sea breezes, gentle whiffs of iodine, which come as a surprise to anyone accustomed to lighter, younger whites, but which immediately captivates lovers of mature, complex whites. Swirling it round a little, straightaway it offers a blend of fresh, citrus aromas, with lactic notes (cheese) and ripe fruits, of ripe pear skin and lime blossom tea, with a very pleasant freshness once it becomes still in the glass.
It is dry on the palate: don't expect a sweetish wine with this sort of maturity; its acidity is extraordinary and will enable it to continue evolving over time. The notes suggesting moisture and other aromas discerned on the nose are repeated now on the palate: evolved fruit, raw almonds and notes reminding us of cheese. It is an easy wine to drink, fluid, medium-bodied, a perfect companion for aperitifs and less complex dishes, mushrooms, full-fat cheeses and any mild dish combining these ingredients. Tondonia white wines relate extremely well to food and should be served at virtually the temperature of a red, remember: at about 14-16 degrees, or you will miss out on all its richness! ","R. López de Heredia (Viña Tondonia) is one of the names which inspires most respect and admiration with regard to wineries producing ""fine wine"".

Vinya des Moré Pinot Noir 2012,£25.20,,Red wine,Pla i Llevant ,Pinot Noir,Vins Miquel Gelabert,"The Pinot Noir is a fragile grape and rather elusive, not always easy to cultivate. It's a very noble grape but requires some quite special climatic conditions. It's Burgundy's star variety but we can also find it adapting well to other areas with a more southerly latitude, where it produces very good wines from high altitude parcels or vineyards enjoying a highly favourable location. However, we need to taste them in a different mind-set and not look for a Burgundy wine from them. If you ever get the chance, don't miss out on the one made by Cortijo Los Aguilares in the Serranía de Ronda, at a height of 900 m, or Raül Bobet's in Castell d'Encús, at an altitude of about 1000 m in the Pyrenees area, or this Vinya des Morè, in Mallorca.
Miquel Gelabert is a vine grower who's passionate about his land, a champion of native varieties, because of their singularity and the cultural legacy they convey, yet he also figures among the pioneers in introducing foreign grapes to the island's vineyards. Industrious, he's a man who likes to experiment and surprise consumers with wines full of character. The Pinot Noir also numbers among the thirty-odd varieties he grows and is used to produce this noble wine, Vinya des Morè.
Vinya des Morè is a Mediterranean Pinot Noir, serious and refined like those we find further north. It's also a wine for cellaring, with a tannin presence, a tad dry in the first years, but pleasant, offset well by the juiciness of the fruit, ripe blackberries and plums. It's a wine that will surprise and delight you, leaving an impression, revealing earthy notes, a passage through the mouth that's fresh and uncovers floral and fine oak undertones.

A Mi Manera 2018,£20.90,,Nouveau wine,Rioja ,Tempranillo,Bodega Contador,"Benjamín Romeo is particularly well-known for his great Contador, but all his wines are a wonderful reflection of quality grapes, extremely well-cared for (Benjamín is the vine grower), thoroughly likeable wines from start to finish.
A Mi Manera is his carbonic maceration red, a wine flawless in the making, using the best grapes, full of fruit aromas, intense and juicy, elegant... a wine to fall in love with. It has a lovely colour, as though there were rose petals floating in the glass, lively, an intense cherry colour with a carmine rim.
It is fruit poured into a glass - chewy, juicy fruit, but with a balance that is exceedingly fine; intense, dense but velvety, attractive, a wine where complexity is not sought after, but offering the most genuine fruit expression. A wine which, even though it is young, we shouldn't expect to be simple; exactly the opposite, this wine is complete, with some shy lactic notes found in the aftertaste. It is simply Benjamín ‘in his own way’, and what a way that is!

Gramona Vi de Glass Riesling (0.37 L),£19.10,,Icewine,Penedès ,Riesling,Gramona,"Gramona created its Vi de Glass range in 1997, seeking the essence of the grape and modelling its products on the delightful German ice wines, the famous Eiswein. They are naturally concentrated sweet wines which differ from Eiswein, mainly due to the fact that freezing doesn't take place in the vineyard but in the winery, in special chambers, in the same way as state-of-the-art kitchens in prestigious restaurants use nitrogen for their intricate gastronomic creations.
Aiming to express all the grape's essence, Gramona makes its Vi de Glass Riesling with grapes gathered late, which freeze in two chambers that operate at a temperature of -15ºC with the help of liquid nitrogen. This favours a speedy freezing of the grapes and results in uniformity. The must ferments for a longer period of time than usual, for two and a half months, due to the high concentration of sugar and this whole process leads to a fruity and very concentrated wine, both sweet and refreshing, rich in exotic aromas, which will continue ageing forever in the thick, dark, glass bottle especially designed to safeguard its maturing. 
Vi de Glass Riesling is a sweet wine of great aromatic expressivity; on the nose, its fruitiness is predominant (citrus fruits, mandarins, pineapple and pear) as well as a floral character, on a subtle background of honey and aromatic herbs. On the palate, it offers a pleasant entry and a silky, unctuous passage through the mouth, with a very refreshing finish which offsets the sweetness that doesn't make it cloying. It proves an ideal mid-afternoon wine, if opened while still young, or to serve with fruit cocktails, truffles... a dessert wine, naturally; but also perfect to put with strong cheeses, pâtés..., as it becomes more mature.
","Gramona is one of the most renowned wineries in the Cava sector and possesses a long tradition dating back to 1850. Located in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, its products succeed in expressing all the elegance and identity of a markedly Mediterranean terroir and are distinguished by the excellence accruing from the lengthy ageing periods spent in bottle, the common denominator found in the world's finest sparkling wines.

Gramona enjoys a great reputation too for its still wines,...",Yellow / Pale / Golden glints,Fresh / Floral scents / Exotic fruits / Peach / Honey / Aromatic herbs / Mandarin / Pineapple / Pear,Sweet / Well-integrated acidity / Silky / Crunchy / Unctuous / Refreshing,,Serve between 8ºC and 10ºC,,Contains sulfites,9.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,1,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/vidgrie_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/gramona-vi-de-glass-riesling-37-5cl/,,
Grimalt Caballero 2015,£54.70,,Red wine,Mallorca ,"Callet, Fogoneu",4 Kilos Vinícola,"Francesc Grimalt (oenologist) and Sergio Caballero are keen enthusiasts of Mallorca’s local grape varieties and well-known for their devotion and dedication to the environment and their vineyards: studying the plants, the soils, selecting, recovering…, with the aim of improving conditions for the grapes, which are therefore able to reflect their identity in the most genuine and natural way.
Their new wine is named after them, and is made using Callet (90%) and Fogoneu grapes, from vines aged between 40 and 50 years old, grown organically, with minimum intervention, in clay loam soils on the Vinya Petita (0.34 ha) and Vinya Ermassos (0.6 ha) estates. Their purpose here is to offer us their own individual interpretation of the Callet: a grape rich in sensations of violets and mineral notes (particularly phosphorous). A wine that is very fresh, subtle, refined and complete.
It may be a little pricier than some, but its limited production, of 1,000 bottles, doesn’t allow much time for thinking it over. ","Francesc Grimalt and Sergio Caballero are the two partners in this bodega, producing wines under the geographical indication of Vino de la Tierra de Mallorca, with a passionate and overriding belief in quality without the need for a huge financial commitment: '4 kilos' alludes to the modest initial investment of 4 million pesetas.

Tres Patas 2018,£18.50,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Canopy,"Created with aromatic grapes grown at a height of 750 metres in a micro-climate of high daytime temperatures and cool nights, Tres Patas is an excellent award-winning wine like most wines from the Canopy winery. After the harvest, the grapes undergo a pre-fermentation maceration at controlled temperatures. The alcoholic fermentation then lasts 15 days, followed by a malolactic fermentation in barrels and 12 months ageing in French oak 400 and 500-litre barrels and larger 1,500-litre foudres. Finally it is bottled unfiltered and unclarified.
The resulting wine has a dark Picota cherry red colour with fragile reddish edges. The first sensations to hit the nose are aromas of very ripe fruit (black plums) with citrus hints promising a fresher mouth than originally expected. Aromas of pepper and anise appear, accompanied by soothing notes of dry leaves and preserved olive brine. The first sip reveals a wine which may seem shy but quickly fills the mouth with juicy fruit and toasted flavours. Its acidity pinches at your cheeks while bitter yet elegant hints of dark chocolate delight the palate. Tres Patas has a versatility rarely seen in a red wine – ideal for drinking alone, or paired with steak or even a homemade stew with pulses. However you choose to drink it, we believe you won't regret it.","Bodegas Canopy is a project which brings together Belarmino Fernández, Jordi Vidal and Alfonso Chacón, three winemaker friends, professionals in the world of wine, business and catering, who decided one day to put their efforts and passion into a wine-growing venture which would enable them to rediscover the historic terrain of the Méntrida denomination, an area that did not enjoy a very good reputation, specialising as it had done for ages in producing bulk wine and with very...",Picota cherry red / Quite intense / Clean / Bright,Fragrant / Fruit aromas / Red fruit / Mineral notes / Spicy notes / Hardwoods / Floral scents,Medium-bodied / With volume / Succulent / Fleshy / Fresh / Pleasant finish / Refreshing / Intense / Persistent,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,,,Wood,12 months,New and semi-new,French oak,Unfiltered,,,54 years,Silica / Limestone,Mediterranean with continental influence,,,4.3,3,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/trpat18_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/tres-patas/,2018.0,

Leda Viñas Viejas 2017,£33.35,,Red wine,Castile and León ,Tempranillo,Bodegas Leda,"The grapes for Leda Viñas Viejas come from different Duero Valley estates where, in them all, the Tempranillo is planted in very high concentrations, aiming for low yields and maximum expression of the grape. Once inside the winery, Eduardo García, son of the maestro Mariano García (Vega Sicilia, Mauro, Aalto), oversees the whole production process. Before wines are conveyed to the barrels in order to undergo malolactic fermentation, the grapes from each estate are fermented separately in stainless steel so as to produce a clear-cut profile of every individual location. After an ageing period of almost two years in oak, a mere 8,000 bottles of this gem will see the light of day.
On opening a bottle of Leda Viñas Viejas, we find a Tempranillo made from old vines (between 50 and 100 years old), appearing a stunning Picota cherry colour with violet hues on the rim. It looks simply lovely, already a winner, showing plenty of slow, tinted tears. The first sensation on the nose is extremely fresh and intense, very balsamic, with hints of liquorice and eucalyptus. The aromas of very ripe red and black fruit take pride of place overall, complemented by suggestions of white pepper, vanilla, coffee, toasty oak touches and India ink hints that indicate minerality. On the palate, its firm yet polished tannins offer a wonderful dash of fine cocoa. It's powerful and elegant, not an easy combination to obtain, something only reserved for great wines. It's rounded, having fullness and depth, concentrated and packed with nuances. It's aftertaste lasts for minutes and it lingers long inside the mouth. Definitely a magnificent wine that makes a lasting impression.","The Leda project was established in 1998 and among those who founded it were the two sons of the famous oenologist Mariano García: Alberto García and Eduardo García.
The winery is located in the town of Tudela de Duero's old quarter, in a big old 18th Century house that has been completely renovated. The winery's work philosophy is based on viticulture that respects the environment and on quality above all else.

It presents a modern look at wines from the often forgotten winemaking regions of inland Galicia. A strong Atlantic character with continental influences, it is an expressive and serious wine with a surprising maturity and freshness. Godello grapes play a big part in its character but so too does the unique character of the area and its vineyards of slate and red clay soils at heights of 500 metres.
 
 ","Gabo do Xil Godello is a soothing, herbal and aromatic wine in the glass with intense aromas of bay leaves and small wild flowers. As it warms slightly, hints of stone fruit like peaches appear with a fascinating blend of sweetness and freshness, bringing to mind honey and lemons.

Perhaps this was the idea that inspired Carlos Mazo and Isabel Ruiz to get this small project underway in the Rioja Baja, the quietest corner of the whole denomination.
Its Costumbres red is a wine that aims to look back, to the years when the vines teemed with life, times when chemicals didn't play a part in their cultivation and grapes expressed themselves with total naturalness. The aromas of fresh cherries and a vibrant acidity combine with the mature and rather rustic central component from which hints of earth and stalk emerge. After a while in the glass, there appear new notes of black olives, fine balsamic and undergrowth. The used oak employed in the fermentation and ageing can be discerned, but they don't obstruct the fruit, doing no more than adding light toasty nuances overall.  On the palate it's both pleasant and expressive, with red fruit as the leading light and freshness the best feature. Its finish, marked by violets and an indescribable woodland quality, seems to demand quietly, a greater protagonism for the Rioja Baja and for its marvellous Mediterranean Garnachas.",,,,,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,,,Wood,10 months,Oak,,,,,,,,,,4.0,1,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/costt19_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/costumbres-tinto/,2019.0,

Ca'n Verdura 2022,£16.00,,Red wine,Binissalem-Mallorca ,"Mantonegro, Merlot, Monastrell, Callet",Ca'n Verdura Viticultors,"The oenologist Tomeu Llabrés has skilfully combined local grapes like Mantonegro or Callet with small amounts of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon to produce Ca'n Verdura, a true signature wine named after the Mallorcan winery it is created in. With winemaking going back for six generations in the family, the result is a splendid red wine combining modernity and history.
At Ca'n Verdura, they were convinced that Mantonegro has sufficient character to create great wines and they have been proven right, with it taking on the star role in this blend. The project started out without a winery behind it, with a small production of 700 bottles using Mantonegro from the grandfather's estate. Modern winemaking techniques allowed them to extract the essence of the variety and two years later their hard work led to the setting up of the Bodega Ca'n Verdura winery. Using their experience and local knowledge, they have selected vineyards from different areas of the DO Binissalem-Mallorca appellation and work them with very little intervention, encouraging natural competition between species. The grapes are hand-harvested and partially aged in barrels.
Ca'n Verdura is original and juicy, a very special wine with perfectly integrated wood and a wonderful balance between maturity and freshness. Just imagine a black fruit jam embellished with the freshness of recently picked wild berries. Aromas of fallen leaves and bay leaves appear as the wine slides over the palate, covering it with tannins and leaving a bitter finish. It is ideal to drink fresh or around 16ºC, depending on which profile we desire; a cooler temperature favours its fruit, whereas it gains in width and depth when enjoyed a few degrees warmer.",,Picota cherry red / Intense / Clean / Bright,Fresh / Fruit aromas / Wild fruits / Red fruit / Spicy notes / Floral scents,Light / Refreshing / Structured / Fruit-forward / Pleasant finish / Long,,16ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.0,,,Stainless steel / Wood,6 months,American and French oak,,,,,,,,,,3.4,5,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/canv22_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/ca-n-verdura/,2022.0,

Ramblís Monastrell 2014,£17.15,,Red wine,Alicante ,Monastrell,Rafa Bernabé ,"Ramblís Monastrell is a wine which will make you reconsider your concept of Monastrell. So that will include most of the wines which Rafa Bernabé produces in his Viñedos Culturales collection. Rafa has a real commitment to his land, which he loves and respects enormously. All the wines in this series are made with minimum intervention, vinified with hardly any handling and in the most natural way possible, without the addition of sulphur and with yeasts from the actual vineyard. Ramblís is a fine example of this, a pure Monastrell, a complex wine with an elegant, clearly defined bouquet.
Ramblís is also a different Monastrell. It offers a rendering of this grape that we're not very used to: light, open, fresh, with lots of red fruit, very easy to drink, and one where the terroir definitely plays the leading role. This leaves in second, if not third or fourth place, the variety's usual vegetal notes, which have metamorphosed here into grey-hued hints: subtle suggestions of ashes which bring to mind certain Canary wines, dry notes, a mixture of Mediterranean plants and Asian spices.
Ramblís is a wine of the land and countryside. It has a rather rustic personality, particularly due to its whiffs of clay and that touch of dryness on the nose, but it's also very refined and most appealing, rich in aromas of red fruits like cherries and redcurrants, with some juicy hints of ripe pears, dry firewood, and candy-sweet sensations; it combines Mediterranean warmth with a tremendous freshness on the palate. It's juicy, with a powerful entry, plenty of volume and ripe tannins, but it also has two very distinctive traits: an unusual liveliness on the palate, like a slight carbonic effect, almost imperceptible after it spends time in bottle or if we decant it, yet it means the wine feels particularly light on the palate (this feature is more common when it's been recently bottled and is due to production methods, since some of the grapes ferment without being destalked), and too a saline touch. In short, a serious and profound wine with plenty of character, polished and elegant; a wine of contrasts, a twilight wine covering that time between day and night, juicy and dry, lovely and refreshing.
NOTE: We recommend decanting the wine an hour before serving.","Rafa Bernabé is a man devoted to his land, who loves and respects nature, and works with sincerity and dedication not only to revive the wine-growing heritage of the Alicante region, but also to offer us wines which are a faithful reflection of the whole wine-growing culture that appears forgotten nowadays in so many places on the Mediterranean coast.

Valbuena 5º año 2017,£159.05,,Red wine,Ribera del Duero ,"Tempranillo, Merlot",Bodegas Vega Sicilia,"Valbuena, despite its long ageing in cellar, is Vega Sicilia's 'youngest' wine. Although having the same high quality features as its exceptional cellar companions, the emblematic Único and Único Reserva Especial, Valbuena exhibits a character of its own, with an impressive aromatic richness and a magnificent harmony between modernity and tradition. A wine which has great maturity, with well-handled oak and a complex connection between vinosity and fruitiness.
Valbuena is made from the Tinto Fino variety, together with a small proportion of Merlot; it ferments with native yeasts and it's matured for five years —hence its name— in containers of different capacities (from 225-litre barrels to 20,000-litre vats), types and ages. A total of three years in oak and two in bottle; a very special process for a very special wine.
The Tempranillo (or Tinto Fino) grapes come from gently-sloping hillsides, with a high expression soil that's based on limestone in Valbuena de Duero. In the vineyard, green pruning is carried out methodically in order to obtain grapes which are concentrated and full of character. Once inside the winery, the aim is to maintain a constant style in its production process so that the wine expresses the singularity of each vintage and all the character of this magnificent and austere terroir.
The result is always sublime. A delightful red wine, a burgundy-red colour with glints of very intense ruby, A complex nose with a perfect balance between the aromas derived from the superb use of oak and the perfect ripeness of exceptional grapes. Wild strawberries, smoke, pencil lead, spices, (peppers and vanilla), and a balsamic note, all becoming more noticeable after a while in the glass and a mystic element which seems inherent in Vega Sicilia wines. On the palate, its mouthfeel is captivating; it's silky and expressive, powerful and balanced, individual and refined. It makes its exit without really going, leaving behind an almost ever-lasting flourish of elegance.
NOTE: Decanting is recommended for between two and three hours before serving.","Founded in 1864 by Eloy Lecanda and run today by the Álvarez family, Vega Sicilia is the most emblematic winery in Spain. It is in fact one of the oldest in Spain and undoubtedly one of the best in the world.

Aljibes Cabernet Franc 2016,£15.50,,Red wine,Castilla ,Cabernet Franc,Bodegas los Aljibes,"There's no denying that finding a single varietal is no easy task and even more so when looking for one that's both pleasant and expressive. Aljibes Cabernet Franc fulfils all these requirements, a silky and delicate single varietal from La Mancha.
Bodega Los Aljibes is housed in a building that's in the typical La Mancha style, surrounded by 178 hectares of vineyards, at a height of almost a thousand metres. In fact, this is a determining factor in the style of its wines; the strong contrast in day and night temperatures due to the altitude enables a slow maturation which enhances the aromatic element and freshness of the wines. The land is poor in organic matter, with high levels of limestone which confer an extra degree of elegance on the wine.
Even at first sight there's evidence of less extraction than in other Cabernet Francs, as it appears an intense colour but of medium density. On the nose, delicate liqueur notes are revealed with floral and spicy aromas. The palate is restrained as regards the tannic element, as the varietal dictates; fresh, juicy and balsamic, with sweet tannins. Toasty nuances emerge, smoky touches and aromas of olive paste, cooled down by mineral notes and hints of recently cut grass. Rounded, complex yet very easy to figure out, a first-rate gateway to the world of the Cabernet Franc.","The winery is located in the centre of the Finca Los Aljibes estate, at Chinchilla de Montearagón (Albacete), and surrounded by 178 hectares of vineyards at an altitude of almost one thousand metres.

Allende Blanco 2019,£25.00,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Finca Allende,"Allende Blanco is a wine of contrasts, of surprises, pleasant ones, and an ideal white for getting to know the great potential of the Rioja's Viura variety and being delighted with it. The contrasts will become apparent when you compare the nose and palate. And the great surprise, or the second one, comes through on the palate. It's impressive, a white recalling some of those superb Chardonnays from Burgundy but with all the character of a true Rioja: maturity, tension and saline profundity, like some of the classics.  A white that few can compare to, genuinely classic, precisely modern.
The Allende Blanco is almost a single varietal Viura and will ultimately become one in time. It has a mere 5% Malvasía from some vines planted among the Viura, but which Miguel Ángel intends to select and discard over time since, even though it's a variety that imparts aromas when the wine is young, it's quick to oxidise. We will follow the development of this white with great attention.","In the glass it's a very bright yellow, extremely limpid, and once poured, the aromas tally with that lightness of colour: subtly perfumed and tremendously fresh, citrus, with a very clean and well-defined nose, yet also revealing some surprising hints redolent of chalk. Warming up a bit, it develops a saline nuance, a balsamic waft and even a hint of the odd off-white flower. It's definitely not lacking in elegance, character, nor complexity either.
In the mouth it is very flavoursome, with great volume and the fruit provision is delicious, with flavours more of stone fruit than the citrus ones suggested by its nose, peach and very ripe greengage plums. Unless you'd read the technical sheet, you'd never believe that this wine not only ferments in new barrels but also ages in them for over a year, for a total of fourteen months, in French oak barrels and all new. The secret? Barrels with a very light toast. And the Burgundy idea comes to mind due to the overall quality and precision. A great Viura, long and very persistent as well.",,,,"We asked Miguel Ángel about that chalky character in this Rioja Alta region and he told us that the soils of Briones, the town where his vineyards are located, are ones that make the difference; clay soils, yes, but with a continuous substratum of calcareous gravel which makes the roots of those old vines sink down deep and extract a large amount of minerals.",Serve between 10ºC and 12ºC,Starters and suppersVegetablesRiceFishPoultry and white meatsPasta,Contains sulfites,13.5,"25,000 - 35,000  bottles","Miguel Ángel de Gregorio is one of the best winemakers in the country and an assiduous vine grower.

Tres al Cuadrado 2016,£12.65,,Red wine,Wines without GI ,"Garnacha, Merlot, Tempranillo",Winery Arts,"Number 9 is considered by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom. The number 9 represents the ternary triangle: the corporal, the intellectual and the spiritual.
With this idea of 'completeness', three dimensions which can reach perfection when united, although each one on its own forms part of the whole, Winery Arts presents its innovative “Number nine” ('Número Nueve') collection.
Comprising three wines, with each one having its own particular symbolism: Tres al cuadrado (3 squared) represents the physical world; Seis al Revés (6 inverted), the power of thought; and Número Nueve (number 9), the transcendental.
Here 'Tres al Cuadrado', in effect nine, represents the physical world, as was mentioned, the material elements, the real and measurable world: earth, water, sun, wind; and equates to a distinctive, pleasant wine highlighting red fruit, spices and balsamic notes. This is a refined wine in spite of its powerfulness.
An intense cherry-red colour, it is bright and considerably dense in appearance. The fine, elegant nose displays primarily red fruit and spicy aromas, with balsamic notes, giving it a pleasant complexity. The lovely palate, showing great finesse despite its power, has a flavoursome aftertaste focusing on fruit with mineral touches.
Aged for 14 months in French and American one-year oak barrels.","Winery Arts makes its debut in the wine world with an innovative collection of three wines which recall the symbolism of number nine, believed by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom: Tres al Cuadrado, Seis al Revés and Número Nueve, three wines carefully made using grapes originating from a selection of old, low-yielding vineyards and which correspond to three different concepts, three styles, all three essential for reaching the required 'fullness'.

Bàrbara Forés El Templari 2018,£19.45,,Red wine,Terra Alta ,Morenillo,Celler Bàrbara Forés ,"El Templari is the result of years working with and getting to know the Morenillo variety, firstly blending it with the Grenache as a partner, before taking the leap to produce a single-variety wine. Bottled for the first time in 2018 by the Bàrbara Forés winery, the new El Templari expresses all the qualities this interesting variety can offer. Ageing in clay, rather than wood, rounds the wine and emphasizes its mineral and fruity aspects. The work of local cellars such as Bàrbara Forés in Gandesa or Celler Piñol in Batea since the end of the 1990s has saved this late-ripening variety from disappearing as many feared it would. Thanks to their efforts, Morenillo has finally been classified this year as one of the authorized grapes under the DO Terra Alta label.
As the winery explains, they have recovered the traditional red colour of some Catalan wines with El Templari. Less dark than more burgundy-coloured wines, it has a wonderfully lively crimson colour. Clear, honest aromas of soil, blackberries, and carob beans delight the nose, with hints of peach and mandarins appearing after a short time in the glass. In the mouth, pleasant lactic sensations blend with the acidity of red fruits of the forest and elegant, lightly bitter vegetal touches. With liqueurish hints, it is both an intense but gentle wine, juicy and tannic. Its lingering floral, saline and freshly soothing aftertaste is slow to fade and together with its wonderful balance makes it hard to put down after the first sip. A wine which does not call for a special moment or event; created from the heart and brimming with typicity and character, it is an ideal drink for enjoying any time, any place.
What is more, if you can decant it and leave it to stand for a couple of hours it improves even more so. Serving it a couple of degrees cooler than usual for red wines will highlight the wilder and more floral side to its profile.",,Picota cherry red / Intense,Fruit aromas / Ripe red fruit / Undergrowth notes,Balanced / Good acidity / Ripe fruit / Silky tannins,,Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.5,,,Continental with Mediterranean influence,,,,,,,,,,,,4.2,6,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/templ18_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/barbara-fores-el-templari/,2018.0,

Ramon Parera, who owns the estate, has concentrated his efforts on working in the vineyard and reclaiming the area’s indigenous varieties, such as Sumoll, Monastrell and Xarel.lo. Undergoing little intervention both in the vineyard and the winery, the wine collection comes under the Pardas brand name.
It is impressive to see at first hand the meticulously cared for, neat and tidy installations where fermentation and ageing take place; it is all reminiscent of an operating theatre, without a speck of dust.
After several successful years marketing a biodynamically grown Xarel·lo, the company decided to bring out a second wine made from this variety, Rupestris, and it really merits our consideration due to the impeccable work that has been carried out.
The wine appears delicate on the nose, offering delightful scents of sage, rosemary and ginger; with a bit of time, notes of passion fruit emerge, typical of Sauvignons. There’s a delicious crisp freshness which gives Rupestris fullness and definite dynamism.

It's bottled en rama (in as natural a state as possible) with minimal filtration.
On the nose it's generous and rich in fruit aromas (figs, dates and dried apricots), caramel and beeswax. Hints of leather, toasted almonds and warm spices like vanilla and cinnamon. On the palate it's intense, with a perfect balance between acidity and sweetness. The spices become cooler, now evocative of cloves and pepper. The oak comes out in a toasty and subtly caramel finish.","The history of Bodega Callejuela dates back to around 1980, when Francisco Blanco Martínez, descended from vine growers and having 20 years of experience in the wine world, began producing artisan grape juice to sell to other wineries and small quantities of wine for personal consumption.

Just 1,000 bottles of it are produced, only in exceptional years, and the profits accruing from its sales are wholly destined for the Emilio Moro Foundation, which contributes to improving the living conditions of people most in need.
All the grapes used in this wine's manufacture belong to the original Tempranillo clone of their oldest vineyards, a clone which the Moro family has managed to isolate and reproduce over the years. A single varietal Tinto Fino, it macerates with skins for a month and ferments in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature. It subsequently undergoes ageing for 18 months in fine French oak barrels that respect the wine's fruit essence.
It appears a cherry colour with violet flecks. Blackberries, smoky and lactic notes are predominant on its nose, but it fills out and changes with every moment, also exuding hints of minerals, spices and undergrowth. It's intense and silky on the palate, balanced and very well defined. Freshness and meatiness come together to uphold a memorable wine with a balsamic finish and an aftertaste of outstanding finesse.","Bodegas Emilio Moro has the perfect platform for producing great wines: family tradition (José and Javier Moro are the third generation of vine growers), a strategic site (in the heart of the Ribera del Duero), pure clones of the indigenous grape, excellent quality soils (clay, chalk and gravel) and an ideal orientation.

Peique Viñedos Viejos 2018,£19.10,,Red wine,Bierzo ,Mencia,Bodegas Peique,"Vine growing and wine making run in the Peique family. Ramón Valle planted the first grapevines between 1930 and 1950, guided by instinct and forming a network of micro-parcels, mainly on slopes, creating a Mencía grape paradise, where work is only possible by hand. The soils of stone and clay, as well as a transitional climate between Atlantic and continental, endow this cellar's wines, and especially its Viñedos Viejos, with great freshness and elegance.
Matured for 12 months in French oak barrels and with a further 12 months of repose in bottle, the Peique Viñedos Viejos is a red that's elegant, with ripe black fruit, tobacco notes, leather and paprika, ample and flavoursome on the palate, sophisticated, with a velvety feel...: A Bierzo in the classic style.","For many years, the Mencia wines of the Bierzo appellation didn't manage to achieve recognition as top-quality wines. At the end of the nineteen nineties, however, a new generation of oenologists rediscovered the oldest vines and hidden treasures of this region and applied suitable wine-production methods to make the most of the true potential of the Mencia variety. Jorge Peique was one of these winemakers.

Also that ""Making a great wine is tantamount to artistry"". Whether their wines are great or not will fall to the individual palate to decide, but their fine work is to be admired and their wines are undoubtedly delightful and show great personality, finding favour with all those who have the chance to try them (even down to their labels, simple but with a very cleverly executed design and motif).
This is a small, family-run winery, yet with a deep-rooted tradition in wine growing; they have an in-depth knowledge of their 9 hectares of vineyards, where some of the vines they grow are almost 100 years old, and they are well aware that only from hard work entailing due consideration, effort and perseverance can they ever expect to harvest excellent grapes, of the Tinta del País variety, which are used for making their three ‘parcel’ wines (Valdepalacios, San Miguel and La Nava) and their two ‘coupage’ wines: Selección and Roble.
The distinctive character of their wines comes as the biggest surprise: their Yotuel Selección is notable for its intriguing Bordeaux touch, and their Yotuel Roble, which we are offering here, for its minerality; it is one of those wines difficult to place at a blind tasting and an excellent terroir wine in its price bracket. It comes as no surprise that the quantity produced runs out in no time at all! 
This ""little number"" from Gallego Zapatero is a lively wine, appearing an attractive colour in the glass, clean and bright. It is full-on fruity on the nose (and palate too), pleasant, oily, with spicy notes (pepper) and a definite rustic feel, and it does surprise, as was mentioned before, with its minerality and balsamic notes.
On the palate it is a fruit-forward wine, fleshy, juicy, with sweet notes, rounded, balanced, with good structure and body; an extremely pleasant wine, that finishes with some subtle, polished ageing notes to round off the aftertaste. A wine to pour into the glass, drink and thoroughly enjoy. Cheers!","Bodegas y Viñedos Gallego Zapatero is a family-run winery with a deep-rooted tradition in grape growing. Mariano Gallego and Vicenta Zapatero, who have worked the vineyards for years showing due respect and determination, have passed on to their sons Bienvenido and Ignacio the requisites for making great wines.

La Carrerada 2015,£48.60,,Red wine,Montsant ,Cariñena,Orto Vins ,"La Carrerada is one of the Orto Vins ‘singularidades’ – from their ‘singular wine collection’ of single varietals. This one belongs to the Jové-Casals family, with Josep Maria Jové one of the winery’s associate vinegrowers. The estate is located in the Les Sorts district, within the municipality of El Masroig, on a vast plain situated on the right-hand bank of the River Siurana, a much sought-after area from a wine-growing perspective, due to the prefect maturity reached by the Cariñena grapes.
The estate only covers 1.3 ha, with the land divided up into two strips: one is set out on terraces, over a surface area of 0.55 hectares, and was planted back in 1978; the other lies on a gentle slope over 0.74 hectares, with vines planted in 1936 and 1956. They select the best grapes from the second plot to make this single varietal, ‘singular’ wine. (Production for the 2009 vintage stands at a mere 659 bottles.)
La Carrerada is the youngest ‘singularidad’ from Orto Vins: 2009 has been its first vintage; a concentrated but restrained wine, muscular and full of nuances. A wine that requires a bit of time.","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens. They have followed in the vine-growing footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, with a long tradition of working in cooperatives, and in 2008 they decided to start up their own winery and make top quality wines.

Viña Sastre Acos 2009,£52.70,,Red wine,Ribera del Duero ,Tempranillo,Viña Sastre,"Acos is the undiscovered wine from Viña Sastre and very different from all the rest. A big wine beginning life in a small vineyard, by means of which Viña Sastre seeks to offer a wine profile that's fruitier, fresher, with more subtle ageing, an elegant, contemporary and cosmopolitan Tempranillo, a wine with international appeal.
The vines growing in this vineyard, located at the foot of a hill called Acos, range between 50 and 90 years old and are planted on a calcareous-clay soil. For many harvests, these vines had produced the fruit that had enriched some of the winery's best wines, but in 2006, its first vintage year, the decision was taken to vinify it separately. With the fourth vintage, the 2009, the wine has finally been discovered by the critics and received high praise: 93 points, for example, when rated by Luis Gutiérrez, in Robert Parker's team.
Powerful and complex, Acos brings together the undeniable quality of its origins and the elegance of an ageing period in lightly-toasted French oak barrels. Red fruits, violets and undergrowth are notes highlighted on the nose, mingling with spicy hints, cloves and a touch of cocoa. It's full and luscious on the palate, a wine with class, plenty of body and refreshing acidity. One of Viña Sastre's best guarded secrets, and a real delight to discover.","Today, Viña Sastre is one of the Ribera del Duero's benchmark wineries, known and appreciated both for the wines of its traditional line (Rosé, Roble and Crianza) and also for the wines belonging to its top-quality range: Pago Santa Cruz, Acos, Regina Vides and the legendary Pesus, of which only 1,800 bottles are made a year.

Besides their aim to be respectful of the environment, the main objective of the winery is to produce wines which transmit the essence of the island with elegance and a modern touch. One such wine is Tianna VéloNegre, a single-variety Manto Negro red wine.

Here they really mean something: Esther and Carles look after every detail naturally, patiently, carefully and respectfully, with the wine conveying the purity of this stance and great balance. It is not at all surprising that Ester and Carles are the people who Dafne Glorian, producer of Clos Erasmus, has entrusted with looking after her vineyards too.
Nit de Vin is made with Cariñena (40%), Hairy Grenache (30%) and Red Grenache (30%) grapes from old coster vineyards (on hillsides with a very steep inclination), from vines aged between 70 and 104 years old, planted in two parcels both located in the Mas d'en Caçador district, within the municipality of Porrera. The wine ages for 16 months in a 3,000 L foudre.
Nit de Nin — one to have in the cellar.","Up until now, not many people have heard of Ester Nin, but this oenologist with roots in the Penedés region, who became established some years ago in the town of Porrera (Priorat), is the person whom Daphne Glorian has entrusted with looking after her highly prized vineyards at Clos i Terrasses since 2004.

Las Gravas 2020,£49.70,,Red wine,Jumilla ,"Monastrell, Garnacha",Casa Castillo,"One of the great wines from Casa Castillo and the DO Jumilla appellation.
Over the years, the style of Las Gravas has gradually evolved into a more fragrant and elegant wine. Syrah no longer forms part of the blend, leaving the 12% of Grenache as the only partner for the wine’s true protagonist: Monastrell grapes growing on goblet vines planted back in the 1980s. The change has led to the creation of a more floral and ethereal wine, which will probably convince the winery to stick with this new combination and make this splendid result the definitive version of a wine which has seen many changes. Las Gravas is aged in 500-litre barrels for fourteen months but with little noticeable influence on its wonderful aromas.","The Grenache helps to moderate the natural energy of Monastrell, giving the wine a more pleasant texture and fragrance. Las Gravas also displays an elegant herbal air of dry undergrowth and pines which, combined with fine-grained tannins, produces a magnificent rounded balance between nose and mouth. Every sip brings with it the sensations of dusty stones baking in dry vineyards while a fresh breeze of rosemary and thyme adds aromas to the more austere hints of esparto grass and tree bark so typical of this grape variety. Its time in wood is only noticed in the mouthfeel, giving a sensation of plenitude in the mouth and, perhaps, an odd discrete touch of spices (cloves) in the nose. But the true pleasure of this wine appears on tasting it, a wide and long wine, brimming with both juiciness and freshness.",Picota cherry red / Quite opaque,Ripe red fruit / Mineral / Spices / Mediterranean herbs,Rounded / Fleshy / Earthy,"A collection of excellent quality wines, rated as the best from Jumilla by Luis Gutiérrez (Robert Parker Wine Advocate) and among the top Spanish Mediterranean wines.",Serve between 16ºC and 18ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,"26,500  bottles",,14 months,New and semi-new,French oak,,,,Organic,40 years,Limestone / Gravel surface,Continental with Mediterranean influence,North,22.00 hectares,3.8,14,98,,2020.0,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/grava20_anv800_1659355409.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/las-gravas/,2020.0,98.0

Barón de Ley Varietales Garnacha 2019,£16.50,,Red wine,Rioja ,Garnacha,Barón de Ley,"Barón de Ley offers us, with its range of single varietal wines, the chance to get to know individually four of Rioja's most common varieties: the Maturana, an indigenous grape now almost extinct; the Graciano, a grape of gracefulness and distinction; the Tempranillo, the Rioja grape par excellence; and the Garnacha, the most sensual and exuberant Mediterranean grape, and showcased in this wine.
At the moment among Rioja wines, we're still coming across very few single varietal Garnachas, yet they have a growing number of keen admirers. Combining the Rioja terroir and the fine qualities of this sunny Mediterranean, red-fruit grape produces delicious results. Here you have a prime example: an honest, floral and very fresh Garnacha, which undergoes a short and very respectful ageing, just six months in large French oak casks; a non-ostentatious, thoroughly likeable Garnacha with a freshness and woodland character that makes us describe it as halfway between an Atlantic and a Mediterranean, a Garnacha with sea and mountain influences. An elaborate piece at a fantastic price.","The Barón de Ley Garnacha is more than just a pleasant wine, it's extremely pleasurable and complete, both on the nose and palate. Modest, but firm and authentic. It offers a combination of wild countryside herbs and damp leaves with smoky hints, saline touches and ripe, yet still smooth, red fruit — cherries, plums and raspberries. It definitely has a Rioja character, some of its nuances might well remind us of classic Riojas (its damp notes, its special refinement...), but it isn't, it has its own personality, as a wine, and also as a Garnacha: a very good Rioja Garnacha. A real pleasure to drink. Juicy and mature, but always emanating freshness, with acidity clearly present. Sweet, yet having a dry undertone of tobacco and cedar. Lovely and balanced, with plenty of volume. Particularly interesting is the finely polished feel that its silky tannicity and fruitiness leave on the tongue, and a background of hazelnuts, the skins, on the finish.",Picota cherry red / Intense / Bright / Bluish glints,Surprising / Higly aromatic / Floral scents / Violets / Toasty notes,Enveloping / Fresh / Voluminous / Floral notes / Fruit notes / Red fruit / Silky tannins / Long finish / Persistent,"The Barón de Ley winery is located in an old monastery in the town of Mendavia, in the Navarre area of the DOCa Rioja appellation.

Clos Lojen 2021,£12.35,,Red wine,Manchuela ,Bobal,Bodegas y Viñedos Ponce,"Once the bottle is uncorked and the wine served, we can appreciate its lovely cherry colour with violet hues on the rim and medium density. The nose emanates fresh aromas of cherries and blackberries, complemented by woodland hints, liquorice and the odd lactic note. At first it seems shy, but its juiciness soon hits the palate, filling it with luscious tannins and light spicy suggestions. There's elegance, a subtly bitter nuance, leaving in our minds the image of a modern wine that seemingly wants to refer us back to a time gone by.","The grapes originate from vines aged up to 80 years old, with some even un-grafted, and are vinified separately, each parcel individually, with the aim of showing the diverse facets of the same grape grown in different terroirs. The grapes, not destalked, are pressed and fermented using wild yeasts. Afterwards, the wine ages for 7 months in previously used, 600-litre French oak barrels. It is bottled without filtering or clarifying. ",,,,"Clos Lojen is a red wine made in the relatively new denomination of origin, Manchuela. This small wine-producing area located within the provinces of Albacete and Cuenca offers in each successive vintage wines with ever more character and expressivity. Its vineyards are situated at about 600 metres above sea level and sited on mainly clay soil with a significant limestone element, which is partly responsible for the elegance of its wines. From among all the wines produced in Manchuela, the juicy, fruity reds are particularly appealing, and most especially those made from the Bobal variety.
This grape, indigenous to the Spanish Levant and already making an appearance in 14th Century documents, produces wines in intense shades of violet, balanced and fresh, with an abundance of fruit, floral aromas and good ageing ability. Although many might consider it a minority variety, the truth is that it's Spain's second red variety, behind only the omnipresent Tempranillo. In recent years, a small group of producers has strongly favoured this grape, redeeming it from its rather productive nature and seeking to stylise its tannins in order to reveal a more elegant side.",Serve between 14ºC and 16ºC,Stews and casserolesPoultry and white meatsRed meatCured cheesesRiceSnacks and appetizersSausages and hamFish,Contains sulfites,13.0,"50,000 - 60,000  bottles","Bodegas y Viñedos Ponce is a family-run winery which has successfully enabled the small denomination of Manchuela to start becoming known on the international scene.

Peixes Lacazán 2016,£16.50,,Red wine,Wines without GI ,"Mouratón, Mencia, Garnacha Tintorera, Grao Negro",Peixes,"Peixes is the new adventure in wines from Jesús Olivares and Curro Bareño, the founders of the Fedellos Do Couto winery. To bring about the project they had in mind, they searched for forgotten vineyards beyond the limits of the DO Ribeira Sacra and DO Valdeorras appellations they usually work in, which gave them freedom to mix grapes from both sides of the River Bibei. In these areas around the town of Viana do Bolo, at the limit of where grapes can be successfully cultivated, the climate is cool and plots are at high altitudes (up to 850 metres high), although the landscape is not as steep and rugged as other spots due to the closeness of the river. Different local varieties are planted as bush vines all together mixed up together in the same vineyards.
Their respect for the cool terroir is clearly seen by the fact they do not use chemical products on the land and they limit mechanical interventions to as few as possible. This, together with the local varieties they have chosen, enables them to produce wines full of character and emotion, like this one; the Peixes Lacazán. It is the result also of wild yeast and ripe stalks used, and offers a brilliant red colour and a lively aromatic nose. It is a wine with fresh fragrances, and is agile, flowery and crispy on the palate. It has a clearly mineral and saline personality, which comes out through fantastic red fruits of the forest. All in all, a very moreish wine! It brings out the particular aromas of each local grape variety used, as if it were a basket of fruits or a bunch of flowers, showing us the values of grapes other than the typical Mencia and Godello grapes found in the Bibei valley. The end result; a wine with an intense Atlantic soul. Granite can be sensed in each sip, giving strength and complexity to the body of a wine which tries to be discrete but whose character comes out to the front as you drink, offering us a fuller, wider wine with every moment that passes.",,,,,,16ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.0,"4,000  bottles",,12 months,Used,French oak,,,,,Granit / Micaschists,Atlantic,,,,4.5,2,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/pelac16_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/peixes-lacazan/,2016.0,
Metamòrphika Macabeu Brisat 2020,£28.45,,Orange wine,Catalunya ,Macabeo,Costador Terroirs Mediterranis,"Probably not everyone knows that Catalonia, in the hinterland of the Tarragona hills, hides one of the areas traditionally best suited to orange wines produced using ancestral methods. In the municipality of Barberà de la Conca, the Costador Terroirs Mediterranis winery has the merit of having brought to light this heritage of ancient traditions, offering a range centred on risk, experimentation and uncompromising quality. Extreme soils, limestone rich in clays and slates, and unusual terroir, in close contact with Mediterranean currents. And vertiginous altitudes, with very old vines, some more than a hundred years old, reaching 850 metres. At the helm is an artisan of the vineyard, Joan Franquet, who organically and biodynamically grows a refined catalogue of rare grape varieties. And he has the patience to bring each piece to a microvinification in amphorae from 300 to 2500 litres, where he carries out long macerations on the skins and leaves only the autochthonous yeasts to work, naturally.
The bottles of the Metamorphika line, as a reminder of the amphorae used for vinification, are all made of ceramic: scenic and effective. Made from pure Macabeo grapes, a grape variety that has yet to be discovered, especially outside the Iberian peninsula, Brisat (Catalan for ""orange"") matures for about 7 months in medium-sized barrels after maceration on the skins and vinification in amphorae, in which 50% of the whole bunches of grapes are conveyed. A mountain wine, from old vines, it expresses itself with great balance and pungent acidity. On the nose it is fruity, with citrus, floral and sweet spice notes. On the palate, maceration enhances the sapidity and tannin, but also the structure, which emphasises the native character of the Macabeo and predisposes it to ageing.","Probably not everyone knows that Catalonia, in the hinterland of the Tarragona hills, hides one of the areas traditionally best suited to orange wines produced using ancestral methods.

Observing a glass of Akilia Villa de San Lorenzo, we see a delicate wine with a fragile ruby colour. Dairy aromas combine with those of red forest fruits, blue flowers, and spices such as pepper or cloves. Its legs and brightness indicate a lively, wide wine which is just how it tastes on the palate, fulsome and wide in flavour but flowing elegantly without becoming heavy. It has aromas of wild cherries, plums, bush scrub, unripe strawberry tree berries, and slate dust. The concrete tanks used during vinification and ageing of the must from the Fontairo (2.5 hectares) plot keeps the fruit intact and provides a touch of austerity to the wine. The grape must from the Villarín (1 hectare) plot is aged in oak barrels, and acquires aromas of liquorice and slightly rough tannins. The careful blending of the two results makes Akilia Villa de San Lorenzo a complex and versatile, yet delicate, red wine.

An exceptional wine in certain vintages, and even though it displays its finesse soon after release, it's a real shame to sacrifice it in its youth. Leave it to evolve for a few years and it'll amaze you.
Reddish against the light, whilst poured into the glass, and a Picota cherry colour once served. A chalk-powdery nose, perhaps picking up on the calcareous stones that cover the vineyard, which gives way after a good aeration to finely alcohol-doused fruit. Cherries, liquorice, violets, Mediterranean herbs and a subtle touch of black olives betraying the varietal. An intense palate, revealing vibrant acidity and a lactic yet dryish body. Possessing all it needs for a temperate evolution in bottle, it already offers fantastic sensations too, although decanting and serving it in a tall glass is a good idea. Balsamic, almost mentholated, spicy and tannic, with a fine minerality in evidence right the way through, as if the ground wanted to make its mark on the grapes, and the old, deep-seated roots of its vines were intent on making their presence felt. There's the oak enhancing without hampering and the fruit unashamedly making a show, as though looking to draw in the taster. It covers the glass with dense tears and the palate with elegant austerity, hinting at stone and oak.

Tragaldabas 2017,£21.20,,Red wine,Sierra de Salamanca ,"Rufete, Aragonez",Mandrágora Vinos de Pueblo,"Tragaldabas is a very interesting wine, which successfully combines rusticity and finesse; briefly, it is a fusion of earthiness and rose fragrance; it has been a surprise and a pleasure to make its acquaintance. This is the project of four friends, passionate about the world of wine, who discovered a magical location in the Las Batuecas Natural Park, in the Sierra de Francia, with diversity of altitudes, soils and orientations, and an extraordinary heritage of old vines; it was there that they decided to start producing their wine, a wine which they were profiling as light, flavoursome and aromatic. They managed it, and magnificently!
On pouring it into a glass, you'll notice its ruby colour, with rosy hues, of medium or even medium-low density. On the nose, it is refined, feminine and reveals some very spicy notes, scintillating; unusual and most attractive. Open the bottle half an hour beforehand, and it will give you overwhelmingly fruit-driven aromas of strawberries, raspberries, fresh berry fruits and ripe cherries, on a background of pungent spices, as we noticed, and balsamic hints with a medicinal waft, effervescent; with time in the glass it settles down and gives way to notes of undergrowth, damp earth, always enveloped by a penetrating sweet floral fragrance of roses and violets.
On the palate that vibrant, effervescent sensation reappears, a tart acidity which imbues it with a rustic feel but which doesn't mask the overall elegance: fruit-forward, floral, with woodland undertones of juniper berries and earthiness. It is structured, medium-bodied, with some marked but mature tannins and a subtle almost imperceptible bitterness which confirms that balance between rusticity and finesse. Very well defined in all aspects, colour, nose and palate, a wine with lots of personality, direct, light and fluid, very easy to drink, complete and long.

La Zorra Raro 2018,£17.70,,Red wine,Sierra de Salamanca ,Rufete,Vinos La Zorra,"We're venturing into the recently created (2010) Sierra de Salamanca PDO. Here, in an area declared a Biosphere Reserve by Unesco, vines have been cultivated for centuries, on terraces overlooking the River Alagón at altitudes ranging from 400 to 1,000 metres. On soils of varying composition (sand derived from granite, clay and slate), the six grape varieties authorised by the denomination grow to maturity. Just five wineries work on this land covered in grapes, among which features the indigenous Rufete.
This grape, with its small compact clusters, is prone to disease due to its delicate skin. Yet at the same time, it's this fragility which enables it to deliver subtle wines full of delicacy, with aromas of woodland fruits and sweet tannins. It seems to have a distant genetic connection with the Pinot Noir, a grape with which it has certain similarities, such as spicy hints and a paler colour.
At Vinos La Zorra, Olga Martín and Agustín Maillo, both natives of this land with its long wine-producing tradition, make wines brimming with personality, employing the knowledge that has passed down through generations as well as the opportunities provided by new technology. At the Mogarraz winery they carry out production on a small scale, with an output of just over 50,000 bottles. Their land is divided into small parcels with plantations of bush vines on the three types of soil typically found in the region. The unusual name of Vinos La Zorra, as you may have already guessed, originates from the fable about the fox (zorra) and the grapes.
The wine presented here is the so-called Raro, a 100% Rufete. In its production, after a light cold pre-maceration, the must ferments using wild yeasts at a controlled temperature. After a malolactic fermentation, it spends around 9 months in second-year barrels. It appears a lovely purple-violet colour, with slight density and agile tears.

Consequently, the expertise of the famous and highly-regarded French winemaker, Michel Rolland, a consultant for some of the world's most reputable wineries, has joined together with the experience of the founder of Araex & Spanish Fine Wines, Javier Galarreta, one of the leading names in business of Spanish wine exports.
In the making of their Verdejo in Rueda, Rolland and Galarreta have been able to count on the grapes and installations of the Val de Vid winery in Valladolid. There, the must undergoes a cold maceration with the grape skins in order to enhance the variety's characteristic aromas. After that, fermentation takes place at 16º C, with the clear objective of conserving the grape's basic freshness. Contact with its lees confers structure and volume on the palate, and the small percentage of wine (30%) that matures in new barrels from Saury (France) for two months is blended with the rest to endow profundity and complexity to the final product, an atypical and fascinating Verdejo that proves it's still possible to make very individual wines in the Rueda DO.
Its golden colour indicates a certain evolution, whilst its nose exhibits a complete palette of aromas: flower petals (jasmine and orange blossom), quince, green melon... On the palate, it's creamy and fresh, enveloping and smooth. With due patience and concentration, we can just about accept there's a Verdejo wine in front of us, yet it's so unlike the more usual offerings it's not easy; it attains a level of complexity rarely found which makes it a special wine, capable of accompanying any number of dishes and providing a pleasant surprise for new recruits and expert tasters alike.","Two cultures, two different styles and a shared project: Rolland & Galarreta, a series of wines produced jointly by the French oenologist and consultant Michel Rolland and the founder of Araex & Spanish Fine Wines, Javier Galarreta.

However, it wasn't until the González Beteré family acquired the property in 2002 that Valtravieso's wines really got underway.

It’s a wine born to become legendary, with the aspiration to transcend generations and leave a deeply lasting memory which will remain in times to come.","Teso La Monja combines intense hints of ripe black fruit and cherries in liquor, with lactic and toasty notes resulting from its oak ageing. After a recommendable decantation, the sweet spices of the oak tone down their impression, allowing a much more exotic nose to come forth, perfumed with blue flowers and balsamic touches of incense and liquorice. The grapes, of outstanding quality, seem better integrated with the tertiary aromas on each additional sip. The wine comes over as exuberant on the palate, with a considerable amount of body enveloped in fine-grained tannins. Chalk is apparent, bringing to mind the soil in the vineyard, encircled by a halo of cigar smoke.

It likes to take its time. Just as nature does. It has been made following biodynamic methods and, like most of these wines, requires a period of time, a good maturation in bottle and some minutes... a generous few... in the glass, where it will open up impressively.
We have here a pure Cabernet with a distinctive terroir character; a serious, fresh, balsamic, mineral wine, clearly-defined too by an earthy finish. It is a refined Cabernet, and one influenced by the Atlantic. A deep purplish colour in the glass, with typical Cabernet aromas but different from those which we customarily come across in Bordeaux wines, without the leather, just clean, fruit aromas, with hints of pepper, balsamic and aromatic herb notes, some subtle wafts of incense, bakery undertones and some damp touches which are surely due to the climate; an undeniably complex nose, so decanting is required but opening up doesn't take long.

Summary of Ricardo P. Palacios' evaluation of the 2016 vintage
2016 began mild and fairly rainy. It wasn't until the end of February that winter showed its true colours and brought some snow and frosts. April and May were problematic months as regards rainfall, which brought about a delay and an imbalance in the vegetative state of the vines.
Summer entered dry and rather warm on the Corullón slopes and the vines, as a late flowering crop, benefitted from these conditions, getting over the setbacks of the previous months.
September was a month of pleasant temperatures which prepared the way for a more tranquil harvest than the one in 2015. The grapes came through in a fine state of health and maturity, and harvesting was spread out over time, which allowed vinification to occur at a comfortable pace, safeguarding the freshness and the ethereal essence of a typically Atlantic vintage.","The small town of Corullón is set in a landscape of hills, amidst ancient slate-covered slopes, in a land of monks and pilgrimages (Compostela is not far away) and amongst Mencía grapes - an exceptional setting which Ricardo Pérez Palacios and Álvaro Palacios (Álvaro Palacios, Priorat) discovered in 1999.

Las Gravas 2020,£49.70,,Red wine,Jumilla ,"Monastrell, Garnacha",Casa Castillo,"One of the great wines from Casa Castillo and the DO Jumilla appellation.
Over the years, the style of Las Gravas has gradually evolved into a more fragrant and elegant wine. Syrah no longer forms part of the blend, leaving the 12% of Grenache as the only partner for the wine’s true protagonist: Monastrell grapes growing on goblet vines planted back in the 1980s. The change has led to the creation of a more floral and ethereal wine, which will probably convince the winery to stick with this new combination and make this splendid result the definitive version of a wine which has seen many changes. Las Gravas is aged in 500-litre barrels for fourteen months but with little noticeable influence on its wonderful aromas.","The Grenache helps to moderate the natural energy of Monastrell, giving the wine a more pleasant texture and fragrance. Las Gravas also displays an elegant herbal air of dry undergrowth and pines which, combined with fine-grained tannins, produces a magnificent rounded balance between nose and mouth. Every sip brings with it the sensations of dusty stones baking in dry vineyards while a fresh breeze of rosemary and thyme adds aromas to the more austere hints of esparto grass and tree bark so typical of this grape variety. Its time in wood is only noticed in the mouthfeel, giving a sensation of plenitude in the mouth and, perhaps, an odd discrete touch of spices (cloves) in the nose. But the true pleasure of this wine appears on tasting it, a wide and long wine, brimming with both juiciness and freshness.",Picota cherry red / Quite opaque,Ripe red fruit / Mineral / Spices / Mediterranean herbs,Rounded / Fleshy / Earthy,"A collection of excellent quality wines, rated as the best from Jumilla by Luis Gutiérrez (Robert Parker Wine Advocate) and among the top Spanish Mediterranean wines.",Serve between 16ºC and 18ºC,,Contains sulfites,14.5,"26,500  bottles",,14 months,New and semi-new,French oak,,,,Organic,40 years,Limestone / Gravel surface,Continental with Mediterranean influence,North,22.00 hectares,3.8,14,98,,2020.0,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/grava20_anv800_1659355409.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/las-gravas/,2020.0,98.0

La Nieta 2020,£116.35,,Red wine,Rioja ,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Páganos,"First released in 2004, this 100% Tempranillo wine emanates from a small plot of 1.75 ha bearing the same name and displays all the expression that this terroir can endow. It lies to the south of the El Puntido grapevines, also planted back in 1975, and forms part of the Eguren family's Viñedos de Páganos estate in Rioja Alavesa, with its modern-style winery and underground cellar carved out of the rock.
There is a rigorous selection process of the grapes at harvest, with only healthy ripe fruit hand-picked, and a further inspection on the sorting table at the winery. Destemming is also carried out manually, resulting in the purest choice grapes undergoing a first fermentation in 1,000 litre capacity oak barrels, followed by maceration on skins for 14 days and malolactic fermentation in new French oak. The wine then spends 18 months in new French oak Bordelaise barrels, with racking every 4 months before being bottled.
This is a wine of great concentration and elegance, with a very intense, complex aroma based on well-ripe dark berry fruit, also exuding keen notes of wild herbs, sandalwood and spice. Its powerful structure with fruit-driven strength and perfect balance on the palate, as well as excellent length, indicate that it has many years left to be enjoyed. An outstanding, expressive wine that thoroughly deserves to be consistently very highly rated.

Summary of Marcos Eguren's evaluation of the 2015 vintage in La Rioja
The 2015 vintage has been characterised by a significant amount of snowfall during the winter and some very dry months in spring and summer, but with an end result of very healthy and properly ripened grapes.
The year's weather got under way with a bright winter and snow, but with temperatures normal for the region. It wasn't until the middle of March that a slight rise in the temperatures occurred and the vines started budding until the beginning of April. From then on, there began a period of mild temperatures and light rainfall which favoured a good growth of the vegetation. May brought with it an increase in temperatures up to about 30º C - 33º C and the appearance of the first flowers at the end of the month.
June followed on with high temperatures (highs of 23º C - 26º C) and once flowering had finished, there were several storms and even hail in the areas of El Bosque, the Vizcarral, La Concova and Trasugueras. By the end of the month temperatures were up around 40 degrees and continued high in July, but with cool nights which dropped to about 15º C and storms in San Vicente de la Sonsierra and in Páganos. A very hot and dry August ensued during which the onset of ripening and maturation occurred, with light rain in the middle of the month and the odd storm in the last few days. Mild temperatures and the complete absence of rain accelerated and completed the ripening process in mid-September, almost three weeks earlier than in a normal year.
The harvest took place during the last week in September of very healthy grapes that had a slightly higher alcohol content than in previous years, a good balance in acidity and optimal phenolic maturation.","The Eguren family has historical connections with wine-making dating back to 1870 and now five generations have been intrinsically involved with vine cultivation in La Rioja. Expert knowledge has been accrued then passed on, with technological advances in production warmly accepted but without totally superseding traditional ideas that are based on an overriding respect for the soil and the vine.

 It is made from grapes from a centennial vineyard, a small plot of 2.43 hectares on gravelly, limestone and stony soils. 
 The fermentation and aging of this wine is carried out in Austrian oak casks with an exhaustive work on the lees, for twelve months, and the result can not be better: an intense, fatty and unctuous wine, with great finesse on the nose and great volume in the mouth.","Bodegas José Pariente started up in the 1960s, realising the dream of a vine grower, José Pariente.

Tanuki Bob 2019,£20.50,,Red wine,Mallorca ,Mantonegro,4 Kilos Vinícola,"Coming across a single-variety Manto negro wine is always great news, but if this wine has been touched by the magic wand of the team at the 4 Kilos Vinícola winery in Felanitx, then the news is even more exciting. For this project they have worked with the Amadip Esment Foundation, a body working to improve the quality of life and promote equal opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities.
Tanuki is the Japanese name for the raccoon dog, an animal which forms an important part of the ancestral culture of Japan, and is a symbol of good luck and prosperity. The winery describes the Tanuki Bob wine as ""an easy-going, cheeky, and mischievous animal that likes to do nothing better than to eat, drink, and scratch its tummy"".
The whole grapes undergo a semi-carbonic maceration in 4,000-litre oak foudres and the resulting wine then spends nine months in these casks. It then stands in stainless steel tanks for a further nine months before being bottled. The grape vines are cultivated ecologically in a pebble-laden reddish soil (reminding us of Châteauneuf-du-Pape) with a covering of vegetation to encourage the variety and richness of the life found there.
With a pale and bright ruby red colour, this wine gives off energy. The way the light reflects on it shows off its vigour and verticality. It has aromas of mountain herbs, wild strawberries, liquorice, shrubs and stones. When being consumed, it is agile but complex; tannic, fresh, and tempting. It has hints of Burgundy wines, or even Galician ones; flowery, ethereal, and seductive, from a rustic base. ","Francesc Grimalt and Sergio Caballero are the two partners in this bodega, producing wines under the geographical indication of Vino de la Tierra de Mallorca, with a passionate and overriding belief in quality without the need for a huge financial commitment: '4 kilos' alludes to the modest initial investment of 4 million pesetas.

La Carrerada 2015,£48.60,,Red wine,Montsant ,Cariñena,Orto Vins ,"La Carrerada is one of the Orto Vins ‘singularidades’ – from their ‘singular wine collection’ of single varietals. This one belongs to the Jové-Casals family, with Josep Maria Jové one of the winery’s associate vinegrowers. The estate is located in the Les Sorts district, within the municipality of El Masroig, on a vast plain situated on the right-hand bank of the River Siurana, a much sought-after area from a wine-growing perspective, due to the prefect maturity reached by the Cariñena grapes.
The estate only covers 1.3 ha, with the land divided up into two strips: one is set out on terraces, over a surface area of 0.55 hectares, and was planted back in 1978; the other lies on a gentle slope over 0.74 hectares, with vines planted in 1936 and 1956. They select the best grapes from the second plot to make this single varietal, ‘singular’ wine. (Production for the 2009 vintage stands at a mere 659 bottles.)
La Carrerada is the youngest ‘singularidad’ from Orto Vins: 2009 has been its first vintage; a concentrated but restrained wine, muscular and full of nuances. A wine that requires a bit of time.","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens. They have followed in the vine-growing footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, with a long tradition of working in cooperatives, and in 2008 they decided to start up their own winery and make top quality wines.

A serious and also delicate wine, which brings to mind Burgundy Grands Crus due to the primary character of its aromas, a floral, perfumed nose with a smoky nuance, and a palate which has the fruit’s full ripeness contrasting with a substantial freshness. There’s no doubt the price is out of the ordinary, but so is the extraordinary wine.","This wine needs time.

Las Uvas de la Ira El Real de San Vicente 2020,£25.70,,Red wine,Méntrida ,Garnacha,Daniel Landi Viticultor,"If you were thinking this wine would enable you to become familiar with the fascinating, pure mountain Garnachas, El Reventón and Cantos del Diablo, and save yourself a bit of money, then you would be mistaken. Naturally not about the wine, but the whole idea: the three are so different, in soil, in vineyard orientation…definitely in character, that each wine should be considered individually. You may start with these Uvas de la Ira, but if you really want to appreciate the diversity and richness of Garnachas from the Sierra de Gredos mountains, make sure you try the others too. This particular wine will acquaint you with Garnacha from the town of El Real de San Vicente.
El Real de San Vicente town is situated on the eastern side of the Sierra de Gredos (in the province of Toledo), in the River Tiétar basin, an area with a damp Mediterranean climate. The vines used to produce this wine are around 60 years old and located in three parcels lying at an altitude of 750 metres, well below the highest parcel, a plot known as Cantos del Diablo (900 metres), from which Dani Landi makes his wine of the same name. The soils of these three parcels are composed of granite, with sand on the surface, therefore differing from the soil that nourishes another great wine from Dani, El Reventón, with its slate. These differences in soil, climate and altitude are reflected in each of these wines and constitute their essence. What singles out this vine grower and winemaker, an admirer of Burgundy and the Loire Valley, is his respect for nature, his search for identity, to reflect in each individual wine the characteristics of each individual vineyard or, in this instance, of a town, namely El Real de San Vicente.
In line with that objective, Las Uvas de la Ira is made just like their other wines, with maximum avoidance of any aggressive procedure, therefore undergoing gentle but long macerations, with 100% stalks, utilising indigenous yeasts and large volume containers for ageing: the wine is matured for 10 months in 2000 or 3000-litre large French oak casks. And the result? A dark Picota cherry-coloured wine of low density with an abundance of tears yet without any tinging of the glass; an elegant nose, serious and profound, fresh and very fruit-driven, with spicy hints of pepper, mineral and faintly balsamic; superb acidity on the palate, with less fruit intensity than on the nose, medium weight in structure and body - in fact, a tremendously easy to drink Garnacha.

Pla dels Àngels de Scala Dei 2021,£32.75,,Rosé wine,Priorat ,Garnacha,Celler Scala Dei,"This rosé wine will leave its mark on you. It deserves a place among the great wines — not just among its peers, but also up alongside all the great red and white wines. The Pla dels Angels is an excellent wine — complex, fresh, refined, extremely versatile, and also perfect for drinking on its own. Pure pleasure and seduction.
Produced with the 2014 harvest by the experienced hands of Ricard Rofes, who is in charge of the new direction taken by this pioneering celler in the Priorat, the Pla dels Angels wine is made with fruit from one plot. The Pla dels Angels plot is a Grenache vineyard in clay soils at an altitude of 500-600 metres. The characteristics here are completely different from those which we are used to seeing in the Priorat. Here the Grenache vines grow in a triply fresh environment thanks to the altitude, the soil, and the viticulture techniques, developed to avoid overripening of the fruit.
Its pale pink colour in the glass gives a clue to its delicateness, but fools us with regards to its intensity. This rosé wine has a strong impact on the nose, and especially in the mouth. A remarkable strength and intensity, unctuous but lively, fresh, balanced, and extremely fine at the same time.

Palell 2014,£47.40,,Red wine,Montsant ,Garnacha Peluda,Orto Vins ,"Palell is the name given to the estate by Josep Maria Beltrán, one of the owners of Orto Vins. Located to the north of the village of Mas Roig, the estate comprises three micro-parcels of terroir, calcareous and clay-textured (variegated in colour), and with small terraces, where the Hairy Garnacha is the predominant grape variety (interestingly, there is an area where no vegetation grows due to the flow of phreatic waters). These Hairy Garnachas were planted back in 1950.

Palel is not a heavily structured wine, but lively and dynamic; this is due to the nature of the particular strain, Garnacha ‘Peluda’, which is not overly concentrated yet significant enough not to require blending. Joan Asens believes the grape is well suited to this area, despite the fact that many vine-growers have been pulling it up, and he has taken an interest in its restoration.

Talking to Joan, he commented that Palell “is a ‘gin and tonic’ wine, because of the cheeky little aromas of juniper berries, aniseed and fennel”. Its smooth texture, giving it such a wonderful mouthfeel due to its juiciness and citrus flavours (orange citrus), make it the most refined and delicate of the Orto singular wine collection; essentially a feminine wine, it displays great subtlety on the palate and is very approachable, with just the right amount of tannic backbone. It proves an absolute delight that takes us straight back to Burgundy.    ","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens. They have followed in the vine-growing footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, with a long tradition of working in cooperatives, and in 2008 they decided to start up their own winery and make top quality wines.

Yotuel Roble 2012,£14.20,,Red wine,Ribera del Duero ,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Gallego Zapatero,"On its website the Gallego Zapatero winery says that ""Respect for our grapes results in our lovely, characterful wines"". Also that ""Making a great wine is tantamount to artistry"". Whether their wines are great or not will fall to the individual palate to decide, but their fine work is to be admired and their wines are undoubtedly delightful and show great personality, finding favour with all those who have the chance to try them (even down to their labels, simple but with a very cleverly executed design and motif).
This is a small, family-run winery, yet with a deep-rooted tradition in wine growing; they have an in-depth knowledge of their 9 hectares of vineyards, where some of the vines they grow are almost 100 years old, and they are well aware that only from hard work entailing due consideration, effort and perseverance can they ever expect to harvest excellent grapes, of the Tinta del País variety, which are used for making their three ‘parcel’ wines (Valdepalacios, San Miguel and La Nava) and their two ‘coupage’ wines: Selección and Roble.
The distinctive character of their wines comes as the biggest surprise: their Yotuel Selección is notable for its intriguing Bordeaux touch, and their Yotuel Roble, which we are offering here, for its minerality; it is one of those wines difficult to place at a blind tasting and an excellent terroir wine in its price bracket. It comes as no surprise that the quantity produced runs out in no time at all! 
This ""little number"" from Gallego Zapatero is a lively wine, appearing an attractive colour in the glass, clean and bright. It is full-on fruity on the nose (and palate too), pleasant, oily, with spicy notes (pepper) and a definite rustic feel, and it does surprise, as was mentioned before, with its minerality and balsamic notes.
On the palate it is a fruit-forward wine, fleshy, juicy, with sweet notes, rounded, balanced, with good structure and body; an extremely pleasant wine, that finishes with some subtle, polished ageing notes to round off the aftertaste.

Trossos Sants 2017,£22.10,,White wine,Montsant ,"White Grenache, Grenache gris",Alfredo Arribas,"Trossos Sants is the second white wine that Alfredo Arribas has offered us from his project in Montsant, wines with short production runs, made from small parcels with the technical assistance of Joan Asens. Both Trossos Sants and the excellent Tros Blanc are whites with great complexity and potential, and prove that this region is capable of coming up with some of the country’s best whites, whilst bringing pure enjoyment to lovers of white wine.
Trossos Sants is made predominantly from Garnacha Blanca grapes, with some emanating from the few old vines of this variety still in existence nowadays, with a small proportion (10%) of Garnacha Gris, planted at a height of 750 metres at Ciurana, which endows them with an extra dose of freshness and complexity. And, as to be expected, conveys the minerality of those sandy, calcareous and clay soils.
Very clear in appearance, a yellow colour with pale glints, the Trossos Sants nose is complex and fresh, with citrus and floral aromas, white fruits and that omnipresent and profound minerality which characterises all the wines in the Trossos range. Fresh, unctuous and silky on the palate, with good structure and maturity, the highlights are the fennel and fresh herb notes, pears, honeycomb and dried fruits and nuts, and concluding this ensemble is a long and stirring finish that invites repetition.","Alfredo Arribas began his career in the wine business in 2001, with the Portal del Priorat project, on the Clos del Portal estate. With his curiosity aroused regarding the potential of the neighbouring denomination of Montsant, he was inspired to operate these two regions in parallel, making two limited production lines called “Trossos”.

Castillo Ygay Blanco 1986,£819.05,,White wine,Rioja ,"Viura, Malvasia",Marqués de Murrieta,"It's not at all extraordinary for a Spanish wine to obtain the coveted 100 Parker points, but if we're dealing with a dry white wine and not talking about a Sherry, the achievement of the Castillo Ygay Blanco Gran Reserva Especial certainly constitutes a historic milestone. In the words of Luis Gutiérrez, presiding over The Wine Advocate publication in Spain, the Castillo Ygay Blanco 1986 ""is one of the best wines I’ve ever tasted"". Moreover, in the same tasting referred to by Robert Parker's contributor, a vertical one with wines from 1919 to 1986, the 1919 and 1932 vintages also obtained 100 points. Marqués de Murrieta, one of La Rioja's oldest wineries (nearly 165 years old), is keeping alive an old tradition which dates back to its beginnings, namely the long ageing of white wines which used to mature for over twenty years until acquiring hues of old gold and amber. Ever since then, only the finest red and white vintages have displayed the Ygay label.
The Castillo Ygay Blanco Gran Reserva Especial 1986 is a marvellous white wine, with a reverence for the past shaping its future, made almost exclusively using grapes of the Viura variety, from very old vineyards lying at an altitude of around 400 metres. After 21 years in old 225-litre, American oak barrels and almost six in steel tanks, the Ygay GR Especial reposes for even longer, a further three years in bottle. The Viura grape, occasionally underrated owing to its restrained aromatic intensity, expresses like few others the terroir in which it grows and assumes to perfection the oak's fine points. The wine’s high acidity favours its ageing in bottle and portends a splendid future for it (50 years according to Gutiérrez).
If you figure among those fortunate enough to be uncorking one of the 8,125 bottles of this gem, be ready to find a powerful and elegant wine that's profound, mineral, oily and fresh, with no signs at all of tiredness; a dry, balsamic, spicy wine with hints of white and yellow flower petals, dried fruits and nuts, quince, bitter orange and incense. If it seems shy at first, be patient, it will gradually grow, hour after hour, indeed day after day, until it exhibits the sort of complexity only attained by genuine legendary wines.
In all probability, within a few years this 1986 will have no trouble in competing with other Murrieta historic vintages, but if you don't have enough patience to wait for that time, enjoy it now without any pangs of conscience; you'll not find a new vintage on the market for up to ten years.","Marqués de Murrieta is one of the most historic Spanish wineries. Its origins date back to 1852 when Luciano de Murrieta started trading his wines in the New World. Today, 170 years later, the impressive Ygay estate seems untouched by the passage of time, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Nowadays, Vicente D.

QS2 Sardonia 2017,£26.30,,Red wine,Castile and León ,"Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Syrah",Quinta Sardonia,"The junior Quinta Sardonia has the ability to keep us guessing. It's like an energetic youngster, lively and spirited, showing its muscle and power, yet pure, elegant and seductive when it chooses to be. Still young and impetuous, QS2 needs time to put on that perfect show; always open the bottle well beforehand, and wait patiently for it to perform.
QS2 may be the junior at Quinta Sardonia but there's nothing inferior about it. Youthful perhaps, like the vines it comes from, but it boasts a firm foundation, excellent care and good guidance. Let's not forget that it was Peter Sisseck who designed this winery project, now incorporated into the Terras Gauda winery group, and that its head technician right from the start has been Jérôme Bougnaud, an expert vine grower and oenologist, a supporter of the French model that puts trust in soils and Nature; incidentally, Jérôme is a member of the team in charge of viticulture at Dominio de Pingus.
QS2's quality is no accident, its elegance natural, a consequence of the balance obtained between soil, climate and varieties. Quinta Sardonia's work is based upon the complexity of the terroir and understanding how to interpret the different soil types and their interaction with each individual variety. This gives rise to a wine like QS2, made from a blend of mainly Tempranillo (Tinto Fino) grapes (80%), Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah.
A wine with a very rich nose, an especially juicy and powerful palate, an extremely well-balanced blend, fluid and with pleasant tannins, that seems to surpass itself with every vintage. In the glass, QS2 appears an intense Picota cherry colour, of medium-high density, and on the nose that dual aspect of virility and femininity which we noted at the start: muscular, powerful, yet elegant and profound. Its quality is obvious, with very juicy fruit and a hugely rich aromatic palette, of well-ripened fruits, sharp-tasting red and also black fruits, with floral notes, earthy touches and hints of black pepper.

Their foundation for this has been based on the wisdom and expertise gained over centuries of vine growers such as Florentino, Jesús, Juan Ortega, Alejandro, Eugenio and Luis, who cultivate their vineyards in keeping with the age-old tradition of quality and love of the land. Their small parcels contain grapevines aged almost a hundred years old, at altitudes ranging between 795 and 968 metres, stretching for 134 km along the length of the River Duero as it passes through the provinces of Soria, Burgos and Valladolid. The accumulated talent of the vine growers and a favourable microclimate give rise to excellent grapes from Tinto Fino and Garnacha old vines which express the complexity of very fine land. As they mostly do not belong to areas falling within a denomination of origin, they are absolute gems whose true worth has not been properly assessed. Galia is the result.

This is the winery’s top white, using the best grapes from the best and some of the oldest vineyards, and includes 30% of the very rare Xarel·lo Rosado variety, of which few hectares are left.
A bright golden colour, the wine has a floral, buttery nose, with scarcely discernible notes from lengthy ageing, and a show of mineral elements after time spent on its lees. It is full and complex on the palate, maintaining its freshness and balance with just the right amount of acidity.
Matured on its lees and with batonnage. Fermented and aged in French oak barrels for up to 12 months.","Located at an altitude of 200-250 metres above sea level, in the rugged terrain of the Garraf Massif, Finca Viladellops produces wines with a discernible character of the terroir.

It turns into a flavoursome, mineral Amontillado with classic notes of caramel and dried fruit and nuts. A fresh Sanlúcar Amontillado, perhaps a little less dense than others, but extremely elegant.
It captivates with its intense mahogany colour and exuberant nose, garnished with vanilla and hints of hydrocarbons. Hazelnuts, aromatic herbs, dark tobacco, toasted caramel...

Mont Rubí Gaintus Radical 2018,£19.10,,Red wine,Penedès ,Sumoll,Bodega Heretat Mont-Rubí,"The Gaintus Radical wine is made with grapes from vines planted at altitudes over 500 metres trained vertically on wooden stakes, a practice common in Priorat and the Rhône. The prized fruit is harvested by hand and treated with the utmost care so as not to extract too much tannicity or the undesirable sensation of 'greenness' found in wines which haven't been produced with the essential tenderness the strong character of the Sumoll calls for. Six months ageing on its lees in large wooden barrels polishes its acidic points and gives it a more tantalizing feel. Red fruit and flowers on the nose promise a degree of subtlety which is confirmed by its freshness on tasting. Unlike many other Sumoll wines, its acidity is not biting but forms part of the wine's body. In a nutshell, Gaintus Radical paves the way for other new Sumoll wines to follow its lead, bearing in mind that this variety has hardly anything in common with grapes such as the Cabernet Sauvignon, and as such it has to be cultivated and vinified in a very different way.","Founded in 1984 in an old 19th century building, Bodega Heretat Mont-Rubí is located on an estate ina large area of forestland and vineyards around the village of L'Avellà in the Alt Penedès region.

Finca Viladellops Turó de les Abelles 2017,£31.30,,Red wine,Penedès ,"Garnacha, Syrah",Finca Viladellops,"The Turó de les Abelles (the hill of the bees) wine is the most prized and sought-after wine from the Finca Viladellops winery. Its limited production (only around 2,000 bottles) and extraordinary expressivity make this wine an essential example of the possibilities present-day Penedés wines offer us.
Each bottle of Turó de les Abelles captures the essence and flavours accumulated over many years in the Finca Viladellops estate, thanks to its environment and, in particular, its Grenache vines. These vines grow in the plot of land from which the wine takes its name, a plot of stony and chalky soil which gives the agreeable Grenache its intense mineral character. The blend also includes Syrah grapes from a vineyard rich in marine fossils. The grapes are collected in crates of 15 kilos and the must then undergoes a cold maceration with grape skins before fermenting in open French oak barrels with wild yeasts. Finally the wine is then stood to age for 24 months in the same kind of oak barrels.
This is an intense yet delicate wine, without over-extraction but with a lush nose. Its most notable aromas are of ripe wild fruits and spices such as cloves and vanilla, embellished with the fine minerality so typical of the Finca Viladellops wines. Both wide and long on the palate, the Turó de les Abelles is flavoursome and spicy with seductive hints of toast, liquorice, peat, and Mediterranean forests. Acidity and volume come together in perfection to create a wine balanced from start to finish, whose final sweet touch leaves you with a wonderful memory of this drink.
It is recommended to decant the wine half an hour before serving. ","Located at an altitude of 200-250 metres above sea level, in the rugged terrain of the Garraf Massif, Finca Viladellops produces wines with a discernible character of the terroir. The soils, which are poor, determine the lack of vigour in the plants, the low yields and small berries, and provide the wines with minerality, as well as iodine and saline notes to the whites, and chalky notes to the reds.

Under the influence of an Atlantic climate, with a notable difference in day and night temperatures and some strong winds, the grapes here are perfectly healthy and undergo a slow maturation. Afterwards, thanks to a production process which combines traditional with the most up-to-date methods, the winery succeeds in reflecting the region's singularity and presents wines with a distinctive personality and great balance.
If, with its Valtravieso Reserva, the winery has been offering us one of the house's finest wines, arising from meticulously chosen grapes (90% Tinta Fina, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot) and a careful vinification, it has now gone one step further by selecting the best of those wines for the production of its new Valtravieso Reserva Especial, a selection of the best Reservas with ageing for 24 months in new French oak barrels.
The result is a more polished and more elegant wine which assaults the glass with intense aromas of fruit, both ripe and crystallised, followed by others of undergrowth, blackberries, sweet almonds, chocolate and liquorice. After these, other notes impart yet more complexity to its bouquet: spices such as black pepper, coffee, cocoa and hints of vanilla and cinnamon which endow the wine with a certain sensuality and, revealed on the nose at the end, further mineral touches conferring a definite whiff of terroir and personality. On the palate we find a glorious roundness and sweetness derived from some well integrated, sweet and powerful tannins. With good acidity that brings balance and freshness to the wine, and extraordinary body which bestows fullness on the palate and makes it even longer if that's possible.","Valtravieso started up in 1985 on an estate called La Revilla, located in the Valladolid town of Pinel de Arriba, right in the heart of the Ribera del Duero. It was here that the first experimental grapevines were planted and the first vintage to be put on the market was the 1994, which was their Crianza. However, it wasn't until the González Beteré family acquired the property in 2002 that Valtravieso's wines really got underway.

Valdespino Oloroso Solera 1842 VOS,£71.95,,Medium Sherry,Jerez-Manzanilla ,Palomino Fino,Valdespino (Grupo Estévez),"The Valdespino range of old wines is a range of unique sherries, matured over periods of more than 20 years (VOS, Vinum Optimum Signatum 'Very Old Sherry') or 30 years (VORS, Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum 'Very Old Rare Sherry’); these are wines with considerable character - intense, complex and profound.
The Oloroso Solera 1842, like the Oloroso Don Gonzalo, comes from the Carrascal and Macharnudo plots; both are matured in parallel structures and are distinguishable mainly by the small amount of old, sweet Pedro Ximenez which is incorporated into the Solera 1842 in its final years of ageing. Consequently, it is in fact a refined oloroso dulce or sweet oloroso.","Valdespino is one of the oldest Sherry firms and owns one of Jerez's most select plots, Macharnudo Alto - emblematic vineyards that this winery has been cultivating for centuries. Known for its traditional style, it is one of the few that carries out production following the classic system of fermentation in butt, with biological ageing taking place under a film of yeast.

Can Vich Cabernet Sauvignon 2019,£17.05,,Red wine,Penedès ,Cabernet Sauvignon,Celler Can Vich,"The 15 year-old vines used for the production of this Can Vich Cabernet Sauvignon originate from Cases Noves, a small village in the Alt Penedés located at over 500 metres above sea level, between the municipalities of Mediona and La Llacuna. There the vineyards are divided up into small scattered parcels, shaping a diverse estate that enables each Can Vich wine to have a character and history of its own.
The Cabernet Sauvignon, along with the Parellada, is a variety which is harvested later. Owing to the altitude and the resultant slow maturation, the harvest is usually put off until October, although in warmer years it's brought forward to the end of September. In the early years it proved difficult to achieve a good maturity of the grapes, despite being planted on one of the estate's poorest soils and well-orientated to take advantage of the sun's rays. Over time, short and green pruning, and patience as regards picking the grapes have allowed perfect maturity to be reached. In the winery, Lluís Vich and his family are extremely careful with macerations to avoid extracting excessive tannins which may break the wine's organoleptic balance; thus, this process doesn't normally last beyond two weeks, with a daily manual pigeage. To the same end, they work without pumps in order to avoid the wine undergoing any aggressive movement and only employing used barrels so as not to make too much impact.
Knowing all these details it's easy to understand why this Cabernet doesn't show signs of inadequate ripening and, at the same time, maintains a fantastic acidity. It's rounded and complex, proudly Mediterranean, but not unbalanced or too alcoholic as a result. After medium density, denoting a restrained and well-contemplated production process, the wine presents aromas of red fruit, wild strawberries, enhanced by menthol and laurel touches. On the palate it's fluid and elegant, proving intense through the retronasal passage, with notes of fruit in liqueur and smoke. Its aftertaste is awash with fine oak and earthy hints.
The only trouble with this great Cabernet is its production run, limited to little more than 700 bottles.

Pingus 2020,"£1,175.50",,Red wine,Ribera del Duero ,Tempranillo,Dominio de Pingus,"Pingus is the nickname by which Peter Sisseck was known in his home country of Denmark, and it's also the name of his most sought-after wine. It combines within it all the knowledge acquired by its creator in Bordeaux, California and in the Hacienda Monasterio winery, set in the Ribera del Duero DO itself.
Spain's most expensive wine first appeared in 1995 and since then it hasn't stopped winning high praise and tributes from all the international wine critics. We have here a wine which became a coveted object of desire virtually from the first bottle, so much so that it's not easy to find bottles of Pingus, because the demand is extremely high, despite their price.
All the grapes used in its production are from very old Tinto Fino vines and they've been grown according to organic principles since 2000. In the winery, vinification is a meticulous process, almost artisanal, and checks made on the wines are very thorough, seeking an organoleptic excellence that is undoubtedly achieved with every vintage. The grapes are harvested when very ripe and the must undergoes malolactic fermentation in oak; pumping over is avoided and the lees are stirred. The new oak Bordeaux barrels have gradually been losing pride of place in favour of used wood and large volumes.
Pingus is a deep garnet colour, adorned with a blue-tinged rim. Its fruit is special, extremely intense yet also delicately elegant and fresh. The aromas gained from ageing show it off admirably and prepare the wine for delighting us with every sip. The nose is harmonious and accessible, balsamic and floral. On the palate it's generous and juicy, offering sweet, polished tannins, fine acidity and a structure based on balance; with a nigh-on perfect texture, pure liquid fruit according to Peter Sisseck himself. An uplifting wine, with a powerful and incredibly prolonged finish, which perpetuates its own legend with each single drop.","Peter Sisseck is Pingus. An agronomist and oenologist who was born in Copenhagen in 1962, he studied at the University of Bordeaux and worked for several years at some important wineries in the region. Together with his uncle, Peter-Vinding-Diers, he established what came to be known as Bordeaux's 'new wave' white wines.

Venta La Ossa TNT 2014,£21.55,,Red wine,Castilla ,"Touriga Nacional, Tempranillo",Bodegas Mano a Mano,"Only between 5,000 and 7,000 bottles of this exclusive and original red wine are produced each year. The Venta la Ossa TNT is a perfect example of a wine made from a non-native variety which has adapted perfectly to the local land and environment. In this case we are talking about the Touriga Nacional grape which makes up 85% of this wine. This prestigious Portuguese variety has settled in perfectly to its new surroundings in La Mancha.
Continental and Mediterranean climates meet at the sandy-clay soils of the Finca La Solana plot and create particular environmental conditions which not all grapes can adapt to. However, the dry conditions and soils suit the Touriga National just fine and it thrives alongside the local Tempranillo as can be seen in the intensity and structure of the wines it produces.
The Venta la Ossa TNT is a treasure chest of small cherries, and fresh and juicy fruit spreading very ripe tannins around the mouth. Reminiscences of oak emphasize its glyceric feel and bring a warm note of vanilla to the wine. This glyceric touch widens and spreads the wine as the wild acidity provides balance. Aromas of violets blend with intense notes of toast and malt from the wood, creating a clear example of the ripeness of a Castilla La Mancha wine but with an exotic touch originating from the relatively unusual grape variety used. Prepared with wise hands, this wine achieves an almost perfect balance on tasting before finishing with an elegant and bitter hint of cocoa which throws open a wide range of gastronomic pairings.

Faunus de Montsant 2014,£15.80,,Red wine,Montsant ,"Cariñena, Syrah, Tempranillo",Ediciones I-Limitadas,"Faunus is one of the first wines that Alfredo Arribas and his team have offered us since the 2010 vintage from his Ediciones I-Limitadas project, a venture that continuously opens up the way both for original wines, such as this one, and for exclusive wines made in a most personalised way in conjunction with other wineries and oenologists who share the same philosophy, or else special editions for restaurant owners. Whatever the particular case, wines like those we have grown used to from his Portal del Priorat and Trossos projects - terroir wines, elegant, fresh and full fruit wines.
It is made using a combination of four varieties, with ‘those that darken the glass’ contributing a higher percentage: Cariñena (30%), Syrah (30%), Tempranillo or Ull de Llebre (25%) and it truly does darken the glass: with medium-high density and fairly concentrated.
Just by pouring it into the glass, a feast of aromas emerges, extremely fruit-forward aromas, of fresh yet ripe red and black fruit, of Mediterranean herbs, India ink, smoky and mineral notes..., an aromatic array which leaves us in no doubt at all that this is a Montsant wine: it smells of Montsant.
Faunus is, moreover, a wine that is simultaneously dense and fresh; a wine with plenty of body yet at the same time accessible; warm, revealing the fruit’s maturity, but balanced by a delicious acidity. Its entry is most appealing, it has good structure and spreads through the whole mouth, growing, with this full, meaty mouthful culminating in a fruit-driven finish, revealing notes of India ink, and, on swallowing, it takes its leave with some polished tannins and a pleasant fresh feel.
Exactly what Alfredo envisages achieving: freshness, elegance and fruit expression. Mission accomplished, with this vintage.","Ediciones I-Limitadas, as its name may well suggest, is a series of wines with very limited production runs as well as a wide-open family of wines, to which new projects are gradually incorporated.

This one comes from an estate more than 120 years old, covering 2.5 ha, in the Ses Corts district, situated in the village of Les Sorts. The land belongs to the Beltrán brothers (the Bertran-Bargalló family) and a mere 0.687 ha of it is planted with the Ull de Llebre (Tempranillo) grape variety. The plantation dates back to 1989 and the vines, growing on calcareous soils, enjoy a south-westerly orientation.
Les Pujoles is paradoxically ('pujol' means 'small hill') as smooth as silk — a really amazing texture for this variety — and a wine offering considerable volume on the palate, with a light touch of dryness due to its present young age. A wine that has its powerfulness firmly under control. ","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens. They have followed in the vine-growing footsteps of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, with a long tradition of working in cooperatives, and in 2008 they decided to start up their own winery and make top quality wines.

Galia 2016,£37.85,,Red wine,Vinos de Madrid ,"Tempranillo, Garnacha",Viñas de El Regajal,"Viñas de El Regajal have wanted an exceptional, very low-production wine, regardless of the Denomination of Origin. Their foundation for this has been based on the wisdom and expertise gained over centuries of vine growers such as Florentino, Jesús, Juan Ortega, Alejandro, Eugenio and Luis, who cultivate their vineyards in keeping with the age-old tradition of quality and love of the land. Their small parcels contain grapevines aged almost a hundred years old, at altitudes ranging between 795 and 968 metres, stretching for 134 km along the length of the River Duero as it passes through the provinces of Soria, Burgos and Valladolid. The accumulated talent of the vine growers and a favourable microclimate give rise to excellent grapes from Tinto Fino and Garnacha old vines which express the complexity of very fine land. As they mostly do not belong to areas falling within a denomination of origin, they are absolute gems whose true worth has not been properly assessed. Galia is the result.
NOTE: We recommend decanting.

QS2 Sardonia 2017,£26.30,,Red wine,Castile and León ,"Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Syrah",Quinta Sardonia,"The junior Quinta Sardonia has the ability to keep us guessing. It's like an energetic youngster, lively and spirited, showing its muscle and power, yet pure, elegant and seductive when it chooses to be. Still young and impetuous, QS2 needs time to put on that perfect show; always open the bottle well beforehand, and wait patiently for it to perform.
QS2 may be the junior at Quinta Sardonia but there's nothing inferior about it. Youthful perhaps, like the vines it comes from, but it boasts a firm foundation, excellent care and good guidance. Let's not forget that it was Peter Sisseck who designed this winery project, now incorporated into the Terras Gauda winery group, and that its head technician right from the start has been Jérôme Bougnaud, an expert vine grower and oenologist, a supporter of the French model that puts trust in soils and Nature; incidentally, Jérôme is a member of the team in charge of viticulture at Dominio de Pingus.
QS2's quality is no accident, its elegance natural, a consequence of the balance obtained between soil, climate and varieties. Quinta Sardonia's work is based upon the complexity of the terroir and understanding how to interpret the different soil types and their interaction with each individual variety. This gives rise to a wine like QS2, made from a blend of mainly Tempranillo (Tinto Fino) grapes (80%), Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah.
A wine with a very rich nose, an especially juicy and powerful palate, an extremely well-balanced blend, fluid and with pleasant tannins, that seems to surpass itself with every vintage. In the glass, QS2 appears an intense Picota cherry colour, of medium-high density, and on the nose that dual aspect of virility and femininity which we noted at the start: muscular, powerful, yet elegant and profound. Its quality is obvious, with very juicy fruit and a hugely rich aromatic palette, of well-ripened fruits, sharp-tasting red and also black fruits, with floral notes, earthy touches and hints of black pepper. Luscious and silky-textured, its sweetness is apparent right through until the appearance at the finish of a slightly bitter, chocolatey, creamy undertone, denoting a most serious wine.","Today Quinta Sardonia belongs to the Terras Gauda winery group, but the project was initially designed and overseen by Peter Sisseck. In fact, the winery's head technician, Jérôme Bougnaud, has worked with Peter for many years and is a member of the team responsible for viticulture at Dominio de Pingus.

Les Pujoles 2015,£34.80,,Red wine,Montsant ,Tempranillo,Orto Vins ,"Les Pujoles is the last of the four Orto Vins 'singularidades' — from their 'singular wine collection' of single varietals. This one comes from an estate more than 120 years old, covering 2.5 ha, in the Ses Corts district, situated in the village of Les Sorts. The land belongs to the Beltrán brothers (the Bertran-Bargalló family) and a mere 0.687 ha of it is planted with the Ull de Llebre (Tempranillo) grape variety. The plantation dates back to 1989 and the vines, growing on calcareous soils, enjoy a south-westerly orientation.
Les Pujoles is paradoxically ('pujol' means 'small hill') as smooth as silk — a really amazing texture for this variety — and a wine offering considerable volume on the palate, with a light touch of dryness due to its present young age. A wine that has its powerfulness firmly under control. ","Orto Vins is one of the most interesting projects to have been set up in the Priorat region in recent times.

Opting for the Montsant D.O, four vinegrowers have joined ranks: Jordi Beltran, Josep M. Beltran, Josep M. Jové and Joan Asens.

With this idea of 'completeness', three dimensions which can reach perfection when united, although each one on its own forms part of the whole, Winery Arts presents its innovative “Number nine” ('Número Nueve') collection.
Comprising three wines with each one having its own particular symbolism: Tres al cuadrado (3 squared) represents the physical world; Seis al Revés (6 inverted), the power of thought; and Número Nueve (number 9), the transcendental; three singular wines made with consummate care, sourced from selected vines in old, low-yielding vineyards (around 1,500 kg/ha), which grow on steeply-sloping hillsides at the foot of the Moncayo mountains, difficult slopes to cultivate but where vineyards manage to withstand the passing of centuries.
'Seis al Revés', in effect nine, represents the world of thought through imagination, a state of transformation which requires intellectual exercise. The wine too is intense and powerful, highlighting the aromas of black fruits and fine oak notes, another dimension.
A blackish dark cherry colour, the wine shows violet hues on the rim and its very high density. The nose is intense, exhibiting hints of fine oak (cocoa, toasty and smoky nuances), combined with ripe black fruits. Robust and meaty on the palate, it is powerful and well-structured.
Aged for 16 months in new French oak barrels.","Winery Arts makes its debut in the wine world with an innovative collection of three wines which recall the symbolism of number nine, believed by various cultures to be the number of supreme wisdom: Tres al Cuadrado, Seis al Revés and Número Nueve, three wines carefully made using grapes originating from a selection of old, low-yielding vineyards and which correspond to three different concepts, three styles, all three essential for reaching the required 'fullness'.

Artadi Valdeginés 2020,£52.10,,Red wine,Wines without GI ,Tempranillo,Artadi,"Valdeginés is one of Bodegas Artadi's parcel wines. The grapes used in its making come from an organically poor vineyard, with calcareous-clay soil and lightly compacted. Their 7 east-facing hectares lose the sun's rays towards midday, and taking into consideration the Laguardia estate lies at an altitude of 600 metres, it goes a long way to explaining the elegance and expressiveness of its fruit.
As in all Artadi vineyards, viticultural tasks follow clearly-defined organic principles that preserve the environment thanks to the absence of pesticides and herbicides. The grapes reward their pickers with a mere 4,000 kg/ha, and the clusters are gathered by hand with special care and placed into small 15-kg crates. Afterwards, the grapes are pressed twice a day for about two weeks whilst undergoing alcoholic fermentation; the malolactic and subsequent 12 months of ageing take place in new French oak barrels.
Behind every cork you'll find a clear-cut, restrained and structured wine, that at first seems shy but which gradually begins to raise the tempo until it turns into a seductive melody. Its tannins are tough but well-integrated, and its initial defiant tone soon reveals a beautiful structure directed by a vibrant acidity; there emerge the now classic earthy and liquorice aromas, which we usually find in Artadi wines, accompanied by a woodland raspberry and strawberry freshness, spices, and the elegant austerity found in very fine wines. It's precise and expressive both on the palate and on the nose, and its perfect balance between fruit and oak bodes a great future.","Bodegas Artadi is, in fact, the name by which the Cosecheros Alaveses cooperative is known, a well-orchestrated project that started up in 1985, in which several vine-growing associates became involved to show that cosechero (young red) wine could also prove to be great wine.  They were successful, with their cosecheros and all the other wines they have added to their catalogue. During the 1990s, under the direction of Juan Carlos López de Lacalle, the winery saw its prestige...",,,,,,,Contains sulfites,14.5,,,,,,,,,Organic,,,,,,4.5,4,,,,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/avald20_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/artadi-valdegines/,2020.0,

Suertes del Marqués La Solana 2020,£23.60,,Red wine,Valle de La Orotava ,Listán Negro,Bodega Suertes del Marqués,"How many Canary wines have you had the chance to try? Their distinct personality always comes as a surprise, doesn’t it? - with that volcanic minerality, those smoky notes… La Solana will bring itself to your notice, moreover, due to its variable personality, as you’ll discover. Made exclusively from Listán Negro, a variety native to the Canary islands, especially to Tenerife with its emblematic Teide, this is certainly a smoky wine. However, the volcanic character seems to come and go, never failing to amaze us and keeping us constantly ready and waiting.
Regarding the colour, it is fairly typical: an attractive Picota cherry red, with a crimson edge, thick tears and of medium depth, while on the nose it also fits our description of “Canary” in origin, yet there is something in its fruit expression, some humus notes, the ones we notice when we go for an autumn walk through a wood after days of rain, which brings to mind some of the Burgundy Pinot Noirs. Accompanying those woodland undergrowth aromas are some drier notes of dust and tobacco, and sweet ones, of liquorice and fruit gums. With time in the glass, the fruit-driven character begins to make its presence felt, revealing a mixture of red and black fruit, which will dominate completely once in the mouth.
If the smoky element is predominant on the nose, generous in its sensations and inviting us to come back for more, its fruitiness is particularly intense on the palate. It has a lovely, juicy entry and is medium-bodied and easily-drinkable. Yet again, with the aftertaste, the smoky notes and hints of animal leather reappear, leaving a warm finish.
Interesting, arresting, captivating. One of those wines that proves a good accompaniment to cold winters and autumnal dishes in particular. The warm heat of the Canary Islands in a refreshing, juicy wine.
(La Solana is made from Listán Negro grapes originating from a vineyard of 2.5 hectares with a north-east orientation and situated at an altitude of between 400 and 520 metres above sea level. The vines range in age from 80 to 110 years old and are grown using the beneficial ‘cordón múltiple’ system. The soil is composed of a poor layer, lying on volcanic rock. The must undergoes alcoholic fermentation in new French oak barrels with a 500-litre capacity, malolactic fermentation takes place in the same barrels, and ageing lasts for a period that varies according to the vintage, around 10-12 months.)","Bodega Soagranorte lies in 9 hectares of vineyards, situated on the island of Tenerife and right in the middle of La Orotava (Las Suertes), a famous wine-growing area.  The estate extends over lands that vary in altitude from 350 to almost 700 metres above sea level.The majority of the vineyard site is taken up with centuries-old vines of the Listán Negro and Blanc grape varieties, grown on a multiple cordon system; in the rest of the vineyard there is a mixture of both young...",,,,,Serve between 16ºC and 18ºC,,Contains sulfites,13.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.7,3,94,,2020.0,https://cdn.vinissimus.com/img/unsafe/p500x/plain/local:///prfmtgrande/vi/smlso20_anv800.png,https://www.vinissimus.com/en/wine/suertes-del-marques-la-solana/,2020.0,94.0
